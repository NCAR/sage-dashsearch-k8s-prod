    <title>Observed humidity trends in dry regions contradict climate models</title>
    <description>This dataset contains post-processed observation-based and model-based data between 1980 and 2020 to support the study the humidity trends.  The intercomparison indicates that the observed humidity trends in dry regions contradict the climate model simulations. This may indicate a major gap of hydroclimate-related processes in the climate models.</description>

    <title>CONUS (Continental U.S.) II High Resolution Present and Future Climate Simulation</title>
    <description>The CONUS II simulations aim to partially address both the need to capture inherent climate internal variability and greenhouse gas induced atmospheric variability by using the mean of the CMIP5 model for both present and historical mean climate as the CONUS boundary forcing. This forcing is applied to a 4km horizontal resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to produce a mesoscale hydro-climate of two 20-year runs covering a current period from 1996-2015 and a future period from 2080-2099 over the CONUS domain.
    The characteristics of these simulations are: 1) more realistic depiction of the mesoscale terrain features, critical to the successful simulation of mountainous precipitation, 2) the ability to realistically simulate the major summer precipitation producer in the central U.S. without the need of conventional cumulus parameterizations.</description>

    <title>MESACLIP: A 10-member ensemble of CESM HR historical (1920-2005) simulations</title>
    <description>Climate variations on seasonal-to-decadal (S2D) timescales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales an invaluable tool for policymakers and stakeholders. Such variations modulate the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events including, tropical cyclones (TCs), heat waves, winter storms, atmospheric rivers (ARs), and floods, which have all been associated with (1) increases in human morbidity and mortality rates; (2) severe impacts on agriculture, energy use, and industrial activity; and (3) economic costs in the billions of dollars. Changes in prevailing climate patterns are also responsible for prolonged droughts, which can have profoundly negative effects on large segments of the world population. Enhancing our foreknowledge of climate variability on S2D time scales and understanding its influence on extreme weather events could help mitigate negative impacts on human and biological populations, making climate predictions an exceptionally important climate and social science frontier.
                                
Over the past six years, our research team consisting of scientists at Texas A and M University (TAMU) and the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) has made major breakthroughs in advancing high-resolution global climate modeling and prediction. We have completed an unprecedented 10-member ensemble of Community Earth System Model (CESM) historical and future climate simulations at a TC-permitting and ocean-eddy-rich resolution (hereafter simply referred to as CESM-HR). This CESM-HR ensemble was completed as part of our NSF-funded project entitled "Understanding the Role of MESoscale Atmosphere-Ocean Interactions in Seasonal-to-Decadal CLImate Prediction (MESACLIP)". This ensemble is particularly timely, following the April 2023 report entitled "Extreme Weather Risk in a Changing Climate: Enhancing Prediction and Protecting Communities" from the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Indeed, this report made several recommendations on how climate science can support the provision of information about future risks from extreme weather and highlight the urgent need for high-resolution simulations to improve predictions of extreme weather events and guide risk management strategies. More specifically, the report recognized that high-resolution simulations, in the range of 10-25km horizontal resolution, would capture extreme events more accurately than typical low-resolution (approximately 100km) climate projections, and it goes on to recommend "a focused federal effort to provide estimates of the risk that a weather event of a given severity will occur in any location and year between now and mid-century". Our 10-member CESM-HR ensemble is able to meet some of the key aspects of this PCAST report.
                                
The CESM-HR configuration is based on an earlier CESM version, CESM1.3, with many additional modifications and improvements. CESM-HR uses a 0.25 degree grid in the atmosphere and land components and a 0.1 degree grid in the ocean and sea-ice components. The primary reason for using an older model version, instead of the latest CESM2, is that CESM2 does not support a high-resolution version per the decision by the CESM Scientific Steering Committee. The component models within CESM1.3 are the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5; Neale et al. 2012), the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2; Danabasoglu et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2010), the Community Ice Code version 4 (CICE4; Hunke and Lipscomb, 2008), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4; Lawrence et al. 2011).
                             
The CESM-HR ensemble experimental design follows a similar approach as the CESM LENS1 large ensemble. We started with a 500-year preindustrial control (PI-CTRL) simulation forced by a perpetual climate forcing that corresponds to the year 1850 conditions. The first ensemble member is branched at year 250 of the PI-CTRL simulation and then integrated forward from year 1850 to 2100 (Figure 1). Ensemble members 2-10 are subsequently started from the year 1920 of ensemble member 1 and integrated forward to 2100 (Figure 1). Spread in the ensemble is generated by applying round-off level perturbations in the atmospheric potential temperature initial conditions for members 2-10. All 10 members use the same specified external climate forcing. Following the CMIP5 protocol for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments, historical forcing is used from 1920 to 2005 followed by the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) forcing from 2006 to 2100. RCP 8.5 is a high-emissions scenario and is frequently referred to as the "business as usual" scenario. It refers to the concentration of carbon that delivers global warming at an average of 8.5 W/m^2 across the planet by 2100. All 10 members produce a warming of approximately 4.5K at the end of 2100 in response to the applied historical and RCP 8.5 external forcing (Figure 1). The warming produced by CESM-HR is consistent with the warming from the standard low-resolution (approximately 1 degree) version of the model. The rate of warming simulated by CESM-HR over the observed period agrees very well with the observed rate of warming derived from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis (Figure 1).

    <title>CESM2 Last Interglacial at 127ka control</title>
    <description>We examine results from two transient modeling experiments that simulate the Last Interglacial period (LIG) using the state-of-the-art Community Earth System Model (CESM2), with a focus on climate and ocean changes relevant to the possible collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet. The experiments simulate the early millennia of the LIG warm period using orbital forcing, greenhouse gas concentrations and vegetation appropriate for 127ka; in the first case (127ka) no other changes are made; in the second case (127kaFW), we include a 0.2 Sv freshwater forcing in the North Atlantic. Both are compared with a pre-industrial control simulation (piControl). In the 127ka simulation, the global average temperature is only marginally warmer (0.004 degrees C) than in the piControl. When freshwater forcing is added (127kaFW), there is surface cooling in the NH and warming in the SH, consistent with the bipolar seesaw effect. Near the Antarctic ice sheet, the 127ka simulation generates notable ocean warming (up to 0.4 degrees C) at depths below 200 m compared to the piControl. In contrast, the addition of freshwater in the North Atlantic in the 127kaFW run results in a multi-century subsurface ocean cooling that rebounds slowly over multiple millennia near the Antarctic ice sheet. These results have implications for the thermal forcing (and thereby mass balance) of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. We explore the physical processes that lead to this result and discuss implications for climate forcing of Antarctic ice sheet mass loss during the LIG.</description>

    <title>Middle East AOD550 Forecasts and Observations in 2018 and 2019</title>
    <description>This dataset is used in a study (Lee et al. 2021) in which we compared total aerosol forecasts in the Middle East from three publicly available models, from NASA and NOAA in the U.S. and from CAMS in Europe. We used forecasts issued twice daily during all of 2018 and 2019. From each model run we validated forecasts of total aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) against observations made from 20 ground-based AERONET stations across the region. We found that the NASA GEOS-5 model performed the best overall in the Middle East, the CAMS NRT model was second-best, and the NOAA NGAC model generally performed poorly. Because dust storms are a relatively common phenomenon in the Middle East and bring significant disruptions both to solar power generation and to society in general, we also examined how well the three forecast models performed during two dust storm events.
GEOS-5 model forecast data: 14.8 GB total, .nc4 format, models initialized at 00 &amp;amp; 12 UTC daily from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019, with 1-hourly forecasts (out to 240 hours for 00 UTC cycles, and 120 hours for 12 UTC cycles), 105 latitude points (16.0 degree N to 42.0 degree N, 0.25 degree grid spacing) x 135 longitude points (24.0625 degree E to 65.9375 degree E, 0.3125 degree grid spacing). One file per forecast valid time. Variable: Total aerosol optical extinction at 550 nm. Recent GEOS-5 data can be freely downloaded from https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/coupled-products/geos5-forecast.
NGAC model forecast data: 1.1 GB total, .grib2 format, models initialized at 00 &amp;amp; 12 UTC daily from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019, with 3-hourly forecasts out to 120 hours, 27 latitude points (16.0 degree N to 42.0 degree N, 1.0 degree grid spacing) x 43 latitude points (24.0 degree E to 66.0 degree E, 1.0 degree grid spacing). One file per forecast cycle (contains all lead times). Variable: Total aerosol optical depth at 550 nm. Limited NGAC data can be freely downloaded from https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/ngac.
CAMS NRT model forecast data: 559 GB total, netCDF format, models initialized at 00 &amp;amp; 12 UTC daily from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019, with 1-hourly forecasts out to 120 hours, global data at 0.4 degree grid spacing (i.e., not geographically subsetted). One file per forecast valid time. Variable: Total aerosol optical depth at 550 nm. NOTE: Archived CAMS NRT data are only available publicly every 3 hours, so the in-between times were processed as linear interpolations between surrounding 3-hourly times. File variables and names were also processed to mimic the files that can be downloaded in real-time from CAMS.

    <title>Southern Ocean calcification and alkalinity distribution experimental data</title>
    <description> This dataset accompanies a manuscript submitted to the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles that describes the effects of Southern Ocean biological calcification on the global distribution of alkalinity in the ocean. The distribution of alkalinity in the ocean is important because it controls how much CO2 the ocean can absorb from the atmosphere. To test the hypothesis that calcifying organisms in the Southern Ocean are affecting the global distribution of alkalinity, we did several CESM experiments. The dataset contains the CESM simulation experiments and control simulation. It is sufficient to make all the figures contained in the main manuscript, as well as the supplementary section. Making this dataset publicly available is part of the requirements for the journal. The dataset is about 92GB of data.</description>

    <title>MPAS-A aquaplanet simulation with convection-permitting resolution and off-equatorial SST maximum</title>
    <description>This dataset includes model output from an aquaplanet simulation using the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A). The aquaplanet simulation was produced by prescribing a zonally symmetric sea-surface temperature profile and by removing land, sea-ice, and the seasonal cycle from the model. Unlike previous aquaplanet simulations (https://doi.org/10.5065/cam1-v353), this simulation had an SST profile with an off-equator maximum at 10N to allow for the formation of tropical cyclones. A variable resolution mesh was used with 3 km cell spacing between 10S and 30N, transitioning to 15 km cell spacing elsewhere. The simulation was integrated for 160 days, but the first 30 days were discarded for model spinup. This dataset contains post processed output interpolated to a r1440x720 fixed grid with approximate grid spacing of 0.25 degree.</description>

    <title>WRF Large-Eddy Simulation Data from Realtime Runs Used to Support UAS Operations during LAPSE-RATE</title>
    <description>Realtime micro-scale weather simulations were performed to support UAV (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle) flights during the ISARRA Lower Atmospheric Process Studies at Elevation a Remotely-piloted Aircraft Team Experiment (LAPSE-RATE) field deployment. These simulations were performed by driving a nested grid configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting model with its innermost mesh being run at 111 m grid spacing. The innermost grid was nested within a grid with 1 km grid spacing. The outermost grid being driven using operational forecast models data as described below. While the MYNN2 PBL scheme is used to parameterize turbulence in the 1 km grid, the PBL scheme is turned off within the 111 m grid, thus, allowing large-scale turbulent eddies to be resolved by WRF primitive equations. Details of the model configuration and data formats are given in Pinto et al. (2021).
LAPSE-RATE took place in the San Luis Valley of Colorado during July of 2018. Goals of LAPSE-RATE were to sample the finescale evolution of the boundary layer and associated sub-mesoscale flows across a sub-alpine desert valley using a combination of surface-based instrumentation and in situ data collected using numerous, low-flying small UAVs. The realtime simulations were produced twice per day in order to support mission planning and UAVs flight operations. The simulation used for next-day planning was run using forcing data from NCEP's Global Forecast System (GFS) while the simulation available each morning of the experiment to support in flight operations was run using data from the NCEP High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), Version 3. Both simulations were valid between 04:00 and 16:00 MDT. The dataset consists of two sets of files: 3D grids and high temporal resolution time series and profiles for a select group of grid points. The 3D grids consist of all relevant basic state parameters (P, T, U, RH) and diagnostics (e.g., sub-grid scale TKE, ceiling height, visibility) that have been interpolated to flight levels AGL using the Unified Post-Processor (UPP). The UPP was used to de-stagger the mass and wind fields, interpolate forecast data to flight levels AGL and to compute diagnostics such as visibility, ceiling height, and radar reflectivity. Point data were stored for select grid points coincident with 3 fixed observation sites set up during LAPSE-RATE (i.e., Saguache, Moffat and Leach Airfield). The 3D grid files are stored every 10 minutes, while grid point data have a time resolution of 0.666 and 6 seconds for the 111 m grid spacing domain and 1 km grid spacing  domain, respectively.

Please see the README files for more details describing the dataset.</description>

    <description>This dataset contains quasi-dynamically downscaled climate data from 8 global climate models from the CMIP5 archive. The data were downscaled using the Intermediate Complexity Atmospheric Research (ICAR Gutmann et al., 2016) model after bias correcting the GCM three dimensional atmospheric data to match the ERA-interim reanalysis climatology (Dee et al., 2011). ICAR was configured with the Thompson microphysics, a simple PBL parameterization based on YSU, the RRTMG longwave radiation and an empirical shortwave radiation scheme, the Noah-MP land surface model, the WRF-Lake model, the BMJ cumulus parameterization, and used linear mountain wave theory for upper level wind structures combined with an iterative scheme to remove vertical motion at the model top. The output from ICAR was adjusted to match the climatological statistics of the Livneh et al. (2015) observational dataset.</description>

    <title>iPOGS: CESM HR simulations under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5 (2006-2100) scenario</title>
    <description>Current predictions and projections of future sea-level changes are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) class climate model simulations. Although this class of models is capable of simulating global sea-level rise and its basic spatial patterns, they are unable to robustly and accurately predict or project future regional and local sea-level changes because of their limitations in representing complex coastline and bathymetry features and regional ocean circulations with their coarse (approximately 100 km) horizontal resolutions. More specifically, sea-level changes within the Gulf of Mexico are closely linked to changes in the Loop Current and its eddies, which cannot be resolved by these CMIP-class models.
To address this fundamental issue, we have completed two projections with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) at a Tropical Cyclone-permitting and ocean-mesoscale-eddy-rich horizontal resolution (hereafter simply referred to as CESM-HR). The CESM-HR configuration is based on an earlier CESM version, CESM1.3, with many additional modifications and improvements. CESM-HR uses a 0.25 degree grid in the atmosphere and land components and a 0.1 degree grid in the ocean and sea-ice components. The primary reason for using an older model version, instead of the latest CESM2, is that CESM2 does not support a high-resolution version per the decision by the CESM Scientific Steering Committee. The component models within CESM1.3 are the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5; Neale et al., 2012), the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2; Danabasoglu et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010), the Community Ice Code version 4 (CICE4; Hunke and Lipscomb, 2008), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4; Lawrence et al., 2011).
Following the protocol for the CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments, the representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP 2.6) and representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP 4.5)  were used to force the model from 2006 to 2100. RCP 2.6 represents a pathway where greenhouse gas emissions are strongly reduced. This scenario is a so-called "peak" scenario, which means it shows a level of radiative forcing by greenhouse gas emissions peaking by mid-century  then returning to 2.6 W/m^2 by 2100. RCP 4.5 represents a stabilization scenario, which means the radiative forcing level stabilizes at 4.5 W/m^2 before 2100 by employing of a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This CESM-HR ensemble was completed as part of our National Academy of Sciences (NAS) funded project entitled "Improving Prediction and Projection of Gulf of Mexico Sea-Level Changes Using Eddy-Resolving Earth System Models (iPOGS)". This effort is complementary to the 10-member ensemble of CESM-HR historical and future (with RCP 8.5 forcing) climate simulations produced by our National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project entitled "Understanding the role of mesoscale atmosphere-ocean interactions in seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction (MESACLIP)". The RCP 2.6 and 4.5 simulation starts at the end of the member #3 of the 10-member ensemble of historical simulation from MESACLIP, enabling the exploration of future projections associated with varying levels of mitigation and future greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Figure 1 shows the global-mean dynamical sea level (DSL) from simulations under different forcings. The stronger warming associated with the RCP 8.5 forcing results in an additional 10 cm rise in global-mean DSL by 2100 compared to that of the RCP 6.0 ensemble.

    <title>Long Simulations of the Miocene Climatic Optimum</title>
    <description>The global warmth of the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO, ~15 Ma) offers valuable insights into warm climate dynamics and future climate change, providing a real-world testbed for validating climate models. However, it remains unclear how warm the MCO was given the scarcity and uncertainties of surface temperature proxy records. Three iCESM1.3 long simulations are constructed to estimate the Miocene global mean surface temperature (GMST). The three simulations included: preindustrial (PI), 1.5x CO2, 3x CO2. Each simulation case includes long time series files with a monthly temporal resolution and a NE16 G16 spatial resolution (~2 degree atmosphere and ~1 degree ocean), covering the last 100 model years of the global climate fields.</description>

    <title>CESM2.2 CAM6 PPE</title>
    <description>To evaluate parameterizations in models, simulations have often been performed with only one change to one parameterization at a time. This is not efficient and can be both time-consuming and computationally expensive. This data represents a Perturbed Parameter Ensemble (PPE) technique, where multiple parameters are varied simultaneously and the parameter values are determined with Latin Hypercube sampling. Then an emulator is developed in the multi-dimensional space mapping input parameters to output metrics. We apply the PPE method to CESM2 CAM6 to understand climate sensitivity to atmospheric physics parameters. The initial simulations vary 44 parameters in the microphysics, convective, turbulence and aerosol schemes with 250 ensembles. This will be extended. These atmospheric parameters are typically the most uncertain in many climate models. We analyze control simulations, and targeted simulations to understand climate forcing due to aerosols, and fast climate feedbacks. The PPE is applicable to other configurations to address questions of other model processes in the atmosphere and other model components (e.g. coupling to the land surface).

    <title>NOAA-CIRES-DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis Version 3</title>
    <description>
    The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project, produced by the Earth System Research Laboratory Physical Sciences Division from NOAA and the University of Colorado Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences using resources from Department of Energy supercomputers, is an effort to produce a global reanalysis dataset spanning a portion of the nineteenth century and the entire twentieth century (1836 - 2015), assimilating only surface observations of synoptic pressure into an 80-member ensemble of estimates of the Earth system. Boundary conditions of pentad sea surface temperature and monthly sea ice concentration and time-varying solar, volcanic, and carbon dioxide radiative forcings are prescribed. Products include 3 and 6-hourly ensemble mean and spread analysis fields and 6-hourly ensemble mean and spread forecast (first guess) fields on a global Gaussian T254 grid. Fields are accessible in
    yearly time series (1 file per parameter).
    
    
    The NOAA-CIRES-DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis Version 3 uses the NCEP Global Forecast Model that was
    operational in autumn 2017, with differences as described in (Slivinski et al. 2019). Sea ice boundary conditions are specified from HadISST 2.3 (Slivinski et al. 2019). Sea surface temperature fields prior to 1981 are prescribed from the 8-member ensemble of pentad Simple Ocean Data Assimilation with sparse input (SODAsi.3, Giese et al. 2016) and from the 8-member ensemble of pentad HadISST 2.2 for 1981 to 2015. Observations from ISPD version 4.7 are assimilated using an ensemble Kalman filter.

    <title>0.1-degree Parallel Ocean Program (POP) output for Eastern Equatorial Indian Ocean and Western Indonesia</title>
    <description>This dataset includes regional subsets in the western Indonesian region of output from a run of the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) version 2, the ocean component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The model was run with nominal 0.1-degree horizontal resolution, and 62 vertical levels with 10 meter resolution above 160 meters and gradually increasing vertical spacing below this level. The run was forced with Coordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiments (CORE) Version 2 atmospheric reanalyses, derived from NCEP reanalysis and remote sensing products. The model integration was coupled to the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE) version 4 using Coupler 7 (CPL7) in the CESM framework. The data files encompass the geographic range 85-130 E longitude, 15S-5N latitude, with all depth levels included. 5-day averages of state variables, surface fluxes, and advective fluxes of temperature and salinity are archived for the years 1977-2009 (the first two years are considered a transition period from climatological forcing). The high resolution and multidecadal time span of the output make it ideal for studying mesoscale eddies, coastal waves, and topography-constrained ocean flows and their long-term variability.</description>

    <title>CESM2 lig127ka FW simulations</title>
    <description>We examine results from two transient modeling experiments that simulate the Last Interglacial period (LIG) using the state-of-the-art Community Earth System Model (CESM2), with a focus on climate and ocean changes relevant to the possible collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet. The experiments simulate the early millennia of the LIG warm period using orbital forcing, greenhouse gas concentrations and vegetation appropriate for 127ka; in the first case (127ka) no other changes are made; in the second case (127kaFW), we include a 0.2 Sv freshwater forcing in the North Atlantic. Both are compared with a pre-industrial control simulation (piControl). In the 127ka simulation, the global average temperature is only marginally warmer (0.004 degrees C) than in the piControl. When freshwater forcing is added (127kaFW), there is surface cooling in the NH and warming in the SH, consistent with the bipolar seesaw effect. Near the Antarctic ice sheet, the 127ka simulation generates notable ocean warming (up to 0.4 degrees C) at depths below 200 m compared to the piControl. In contrast, the addition of freshwater in the North Atlantic in the 127kaFW run results in a multi-century subsurface ocean cooling that rebounds slowly over multiple millennia near the Antarctic ice sheet. These results have implications for the thermal forcing (and thereby mass balance) of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. We explore the physical processes that lead to this result and discuss implications for climate forcing of Antarctic ice sheet mass loss during the LIG.</description>

    <title>A Statistical Analysis of Lossily Compressed CESM-LENS Data</title>
    <description> The data storage burden resulting from CESM simulations continues to grow, and lossy data compression methods can alleviate this burden, provided that key climate variables are not altered to the point of affecting scientific conclusions. This dataset was generated to evaluate the effects of two leading lossy compression algorithms, SZ and ZFP, on daily output data from the CESM-LENS dataset. In particular, it contains daily data for variables TS (surface temperature) and PRECT (precipitation rate) from the historical forcing period (1920-2005) for CESM-LENS ensemble member 30. The provided data has been compressed and reconstructed via two popular compressors: SZ 1.4.13 and ZFP 0.5.3 with a number of different absolute error tolerances. Errors due to compression can be determined by comparing these reconstructed files to the original CESM-LENS timeseries data, and statistical methods can evaluate the errors at different spatiotemporal scales. While both compression algorithms show promising fidelity with the original output, detectable artifacts are introduced even at relatively tight error tolerances.</description>

    <title>Improving representation of stratospheric Polar Vortex in Southern Hemisphere with low-frequency frontal waves</title>
    <description>Many global models tend to produce a stratospheric polar vortex in the Southern Hemisphere winter that is too strong and too cold - a common issue known as the "cold-pole bias". This bias can affect how models simulate important features like the ozone hole. In this study, we use a development version of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) at various horizontal resolutions. We find that higher-resolution simulations reduce the cold-pole bias and better capture the structure of the polar vortex. Motivated by this improvement, we introduce a new scheme to represent a source of frontal gravity waves that so far have been missing in the model. Including this new source representation leads to significant improvements in the model's ability to simulate the Southern Hemisphere stratospheric polar vortex, particularly in wind speeds and the vertical structure of the jet stream. </description>

    <description>The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry version 3.9.1 is used to generate a 48-hour air quality forecast daily at 12 km grid spacing over the CONUS.
    The first 24 forecast files are available here. This WRF-Chem model simulates the emission, transport, mixing, and chemical transformation of trace gases and aerosols simultaneously with the meteorology. These forecasts are used to support air quality decision-making, field campaign planning, early identification of model errors and biases, and support the atmospheric science community in their research. This system aims to complement the operational air quality forecasts produced by the National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), not to replace them. A publicly available information dissemination system has been established that displays various air quality products, including a near-real-time evaluation of the model forecasts at the

    <title>MESACLIP: A 500-year CESM HR pre-industrial control simulation forced with perpetual 1850 conditions</title>
    <description>Climate variations on seasonal-to-decadal (S2D) timescales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales an invaluable tool for policymakers and stakeholders. Such variations modulate the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events including, tropical cyclones (TCs), heat waves, winter storms, atmospheric rivers (ARs), and floods, which have all been associated with (1) increases in human morbidity and mortality rates; (2) severe impacts on agriculture, energy use, and industrial activity; and (3) economic costs in the billions of dollars. Changes in prevailing climate patterns are also responsible for prolonged droughts, which can have profoundly negative effects on large segments of the world population. Enhancing our foreknowledge of climate variability on S2D time scales and understanding its influence on extreme weather events could help mitigate negative impacts on human and biological populations, making climate predictions an exceptionally important climate and social science frontier. 
                                
Over the past six years, our research team consisting of scientists at Texas A and M University (TAMU) and the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) has made major breakthroughs in advancing high-resolution global climate modeling and prediction. We have completed an unprecedented 10-member ensemble of Community Earth System Model (CESM) historical and future climate simulations at a TC-permitting and ocean-eddy-rich resolution (hereafter simply referred to as CESM-HR). This CESM-HR ensemble was completed as part of our NSF-funded project entitled "Understanding the Role of MESoscale Atmosphere-Ocean Interactions in Seasonal-to-Decadal CLImate Prediction (MESACLIP)". This ensemble is particularly timely, following the April 2023 report entitled "Extreme Weather Risk in a Changing Climate: Enhancing Prediction and Protecting Communities" from the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Indeed, this report made several recommendations on how climate science can support the provision of information about future risks from extreme weather and highlight the urgent need for high-resolution simulations to improve predictions of extreme weather events and guide risk management strategies. More specifically, the report recognized that high-resolution simulations, in the range of 10-25km horizontal resolution, would capture extreme events more accurately than typical low-resolution (approximately 100km) climate projections, and it goes on to recommend "a focused federal effort to provide estimates of the risk that a weather event of a given severity will occur in any location and year between now and mid-century". Our 10-member CESM-HR ensemble is able to meet some of the key aspects of this PCAST report.
                                
The CESM-HR configuration is based on an earlier CESM version, CESM1.3, with many additional modifications and improvements. CESM-HR uses a 0.25 degree grid in the atmosphere and land components and a 0.1 degree grid in the ocean and sea-ice components. The primary reason for using an older model version, instead of the latest CESM2, is that CESM2 does not support a high-resolution version per the decision by the CESM Scientific Steering Committee. The component models within CESM1.3 are the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5; Neale et al. 2012), the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2; Danabasoglu et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2010), the Community Ice Code version 4 (CICE4; Hunke and Lipscomb, 2008), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4; Lawrence et al. 2011).
                             
The CESM-HR ensemble experimental design follows a similar approach as the CESM LENS1 large ensemble. We started with a 500-year preindustrial control (PI-CTRL) simulation forced by a perpetual climate forcing that corresponds to the year 1850 conditions. The first ensemble member is branched at year 250 of the PI-CTRL simulation and then integrated forward from year 1850 to 2100 (Figure 1). Ensemble members 2-10 are subsequently started from the year 1920 of ensemble member 1 and integrated forward to 2100 (Figure 1). Spread in the ensemble is generated by applying round-off level perturbations in the atmospheric potential temperature initial conditions for members 2-10. All 10 members use the same specified external climate forcing. Following the CMIP5 protocol for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments, historical forcing is used from 1920 to 2005 followed by the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) forcing from 2006 to 2100. RCP 8.5 is a high-emissions scenario and is frequently referred to as the "business as usual" scenario. It refers to the concentration of carbon that delivers global warming at an average of 8.5 W/m^2 across the planet by 2100. All 10 members produce a warming of approximately 4.5K at the end of 2100 in response to the applied historical and RCP 8.5 external forcing (Figure 1). The warming produced by CESM-HR is consistent with the warming from the standard low-resolution (approximately 1 degree) version of the model. The rate of warming simulated by CESM-HR over the observed period agrees very well with the observed rate of warming derived from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis (Figure 1).

    <title>Multi-decadal historical regional hydroclimate simulation with two mid 21st century Pseudo-Global Warming futures over Alaska and the Yukon at 4 km resolution</title>
    <description>Hydroclimate and terrestrial hydrology greatly influence the local communities, ecosystems, and economies across Alaska and Yukon River Basin. Therefore, we utilized the Regional Arctic Systems Model (RASM) to model the coupled land-atmosphere, and generated a climate and hydrology dataset at 4-km grid spacing to improve our understanding of the regional hydroclimate and terrestrial hydrology. Our model domain encompasses all of the U.S. State of Alaska, the entire Yukon River Basin, part of Western Canada, and the eastern coastal region of Russia. This dataset includes 1) one simulation of the historical climate (Water Years 1991-2021), which serves as a benchmark for climate change studies, and 2) two future simulations (Equivalent Water Years 2035-2065) using the Pseudo-Global Warming method under future greenhouse gas emission scenario SSP2-4.5. The two future scenarios represent median and high changes derived from ensemble means across different Global Climate Models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 within SSP2-4.5 respectively. The microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) atmospheric model were manually tuned for optimal model performance. The land component in RASM was replaced using the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) given its comprehensive process representations for cold regions. We conducted optimization for uncoupled CTSM to improve its performance in terrestrial hydrologic simulations, especially streamflow and snow (Cheng et al., 2023). In order to maintain the quality for both hydroclimate and terrestrial hydrologic simulation, we implemented a strategy of iterative testing and re-optimization of CTSM. This dataset was then generated using RASM with optimized CTSM parameters and manually tuned WRF microphysics. The historical simulation was evaluated against multiple observational datasets for five key weather variables and hydrologic fluxes, including precipitation, air temperature, snow fraction, evaporation-to-precipitation ratios, and streamflow. The evaluation details can be found in Cheng et al. (2024).</description>

    <title>WACCM-X High-Resolution Nature Run</title>
    <description>A new version of NSF NCAR CESM Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere/ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) has been developed. The main feature of this version is the species-dependent spectral element (SE) dynamical core solved on a cubed sphere grid, eliminating the polar singularity and enabling simulations at high-resolutions. Molecular viscosity and diffusion in the horizontal direction are also included. The Conservative semi-Lagrangian Multi-Tracer Transport Scheme (CSLAM) is employed for the species transport. An efficient regridding scheme based on the Earth System Modeling Framework is used to map fields between the physics mesh and geomagnetic grid. The WACCM-X high-resolution (NE120) Nature Run refers to the simulation with ~25 km horizontal resolution and 0.1 scale height vertical resolution resolutions for a full year. </description>

    <title>GARD-LENS: A downscaled large ensemble dataset for understanding the future climate and its uncertainties</title>
    <description>The Generalized Analog Regression Downscaling method Large Ensemble (GARD-LENS) dataset  is comprised of daily precipitation, mean temperature, and temperature range over the Contiguous U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii at 12 km, 4 km, and 1 km resolutions, respectively. GARD-LENS downscales three CMIP6 global climate model large ensembles, CESM2, CanESM5, and EC-Earth3, totaling 200 ensemble members. GARD-LENS is the first downscaled SMILE (single model initial-condition large ensemble), providing information about the role of internal climate variability at high resolutions. GARD LENS uses GMET as a training dataset for the period 1980-2014, although Hawaii GMET data is only available for 1990-2014. The total dataset consists of 200 ensemble member files per region per variable (e.g., 200 files for t_mean for CONUS), for a total of 1800 files and a total dataset size of roughly 12 TB.
    The 150-year record of this large ensemble dataset provides ample data for assessing trends and extremes and allows users to robustly assess internal variability, forced climate signals, and time of emergence at high resolutions. As the need for high resolution, robust climate datasets continues to grow, GARD-LENS will be a valuable tool for scientists and practitioners who wish to account for internal variability in their future climate analyses and adaptation plans.</description>

    <title>WRF-Chem Simulations of Dust Storms With and Without Inserting SMAP Soil Moisture Retrievals</title>
    <description>In that study, eight dust storms in the western U.S. from 2015-2021 were simulated with the WRF-Chem model at 9 km grid spacing, with one simulation directly inserting soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite into WRF-Chem ("Insert SMAP"), and the other leaving the WRF-Chem soil moisture field uncorrected ("No SMAP"). Model simulations were validated against ASOS METAR observations of 10 m wind speed, U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) observations of soil moisture content, Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrievals of aerosol optical depth (AOD), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrievals of AOD.
For all eight cases, this dataset includes 1-hourly and 15-minute WRF-Chem model output for both Insert SMAP and No SMAP experiments for a limited set of relevant variables, USCRN station observations, AERONET station retrievals, and matched-pairs of valid MODIS AOD retrievals with WRF-Chem simulated AOD.

    <title>En-GARD Downscaled Climate Data over the Colorado River Basin</title>
    <description>Daily precipitation and temperature data from 18 Global Climate Models (GCM) in the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that were downscaled using an analog regression approach in En-GARD (Gutmann et al. 2022) over the Colorado River Basin from 1950-2099. En-GARD is a statistical downscaling method designed to use information about upper level atmospheric processes (e.g. 500 mb winds) in addition to processes observed at the surface (e.g. precipitation and temperature). Each GCM was downscaled using training data from ERA-Interim reanalysis (Dee et al. 2011) and observations from the Livneh meteorological dataset (Livneh et al. 2015). Daily GCM precipitation and temperature were downscaled independently for each monthly basis (+/- 15 days for training) and on a grid-cell by grid cell basis. The GCM and ERA-Interim data were bilinearly interpolated to the Livneh 1/16 degree grid for input. Input data (Precipitation/Temperature, 500 mb zonal and meridional wind speeds) were quantile mapped to the corresponding ERA-Interim data and the closest 200 analog days, or days in which the input data matched the large-scale surface and upper atmospheric features, were selected independently for each day to be downscaled and used to train a multivariate linear regression to predict the Livneh data from those analog days. For precipitation, occurrence is modeled separately from magnitude by using a logistic regression with the same analog days to predict the probability of precipitation. To preserve realistic spatiotemporal variability, the residual term from the regression model is saved, and this residual is used to condition a stochastic sampling of the probability distribution for the prediction. Each output variable from En-GARD was quantile mapped to the Livneh meteorological data on a monthly basis to be used as input for a hydrological model that was calibrated using the Livneh meteorological data. More description of the En-GARD methodology can be found in Gutmann et al. (2022).</description>

    <title>PlioMIP1 simulations with CESM1 (CAM4) and CESM1 (CAM5)</title>
    <description>The CESM mid-Pliocene project, completed by Bette Otto-Bliesner, Ran Feng, Esther Brady, and Nan Rosenbloom, is a set of published simulations to understand mid-Pliocene climate variability, similarities and dissimilarities with pre-Industrial, and model skills in simulating this period. One experiment contributes to the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project phase 1 (PlioMIP1). The rest are sensitivity experiments branched from the PlioMIP1 experiment. These sensitivity experiments quantify mid-Pliocene climate responses to closure of the Bering Strait, closure of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago Straits, variations of CO2, variations of orbital forcings, absence of the western Antarctic Ice Sheet, and changes in tropospheric aerosol conditions.
All simulations are performed with the atmosphere-ocean-land-sea ice coupled CESM1 at the nominal 1-degree latitude/longitude. Except for experiments designed to understand responses to aerosol changes (used CAM5.3), the rest of experiments use the CAM4 version of the atmospheric model. Descriptions of experiments featuring PlioMIP1 protocol, Strait Closure, CO2 and orbital forcing variations, or different tropospheric aerosol conditions can be separately found in Rosenbloom (2013), Otto-Bliesner et al., (2017), Feng et al., (2017), Feng et al., (2019).

    <title>Runoff Risk V3.0 Hydrometeorological Dataset</title>
    <description>This dataset provides retrospective runoff risk forecasts and supporting data for the Great Lakes region. 
It includes retrospective simulations from the NOAA National Water Model (NWM) configuration of WRF-Hydro. These simulations were executed to produce approximately 25 additional land surface grid variables, along with surface and subsurface runoff outputs, identified as crucial for predicting runoff initiation at the edge of field.
Two distinct processing workflows were used to generate the final forecast products. The first workflow employs a statistical post-processing approach, including quantile mapping bias correction, which adjusts NWM surface runoff predictions based on edge-of-field observations and USGS streamflow data. This workflow also incorporates a regionalization of the statistical model and bias correction using a Hydrologic Unit Code 10 (HUC10) level cluster analysis. The second, more streamlined workflow, consists solely of the bias correction of NWM output.
This collection contains the raw WRF-Hydro outputs and the outputs from both retrospective forecast workflows. The data can be used to assess the skill of NWM-based runoff risk predictions and to compare the performance of the two different post-processing strategies. The primary goal of this dataset is to support the transition of these improved runoff risk tools into an operational environment at the NOAA Office of Water Prediction, ultimately aiding farmers in optimizing manure application timing to reduce nutrient runoff into the Great Lakes.</description>

    <title>NCAR Global Climate Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (CFDDA) Hourly 40 km Reanalysis</title>
    <description>NCAR Global Climate Four-Dimensional Data Assimilation (CFDDA) Hourly 40 km Reanalysis dataset is a dynamically-downscaled dataset with high temporal and spatial resolution that was created using NCAR's CFDDA system.  At the core of the CFDDA system is the 5th generation Pennsylvania State University / NCAR mesoscale model (MM5). The dataset contains three-dimensional hourly analyses in netCDF format for the global atmospheric state from 1985 to 2005 on a 40 km horizontal grid (0.4 degree grid increment) with 28 vertical levels.  As a result, the dataset provides a collection of hourly, meso-beta scale reanalyses files for all the days of the months within the 21-year period, providing good representation of local forcing and the diurnal variation of processes in the planetary boundary layer.  At the time of its creation, this was the only reanalysis dataset with full three-dimensional fields available at hourly intervals.The dataset was generated by continuously assimilating standard surface and upper-air observations.  Hourly and 6-hourly surface data and upper-air measurements (primarily 12- and 24-hourly rawinsondes) were assimilated.  Initial land surface conditions were based on the NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) on a 1 degree by 1 degree latitude-longitude grid, compiled using the Noah land surface model (LSM), where GLDAS values for substrate soil moisture and temperature, ground skin temperature, and snow water equivalent were used.  Daily sea surface temperatures (SSTs) were specified by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Version 2.0 global and daily SST dataset defined on a 0.25 degree by 0.25 degree grid.</description>

    <title>Directional Analysis of the Storm Surge from Hurricane Sandy 2012</title>
    <description>Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012 drove before it a storm surge that rose to 4.28 meters above mean lower low water at The Battery in lower Manhattan, and flooded the Hugh L. Carey automobile tunnel between Brooklyn and The Battery. This study examines the surge event in New York Harbor using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model and the Coupled-Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave- Sediment Transport / Regional Ocean Modeling System (COAWST/ROMS). We present a new technique using directional analysis to calculate and display maps of a coastline's potential for storm surge; these maps are constructed from wind fields blowing from eight fixed compass directions. This analysis approximates the surge observed during Hurricane Sandy. The directional analysis is then applied to surge events at Charleston, South Carolina, New Orleans, Louisiana, and Tacloban City, the Philippines. </description>

    <title>Simulation of the Transient Climate of the Last 21,000 Years (TraCE-21ka)</title>
    <description>This TraCE-21ka dataset contains output from the full TraCE simulation from 22,000 years before present (22ka) to 1990 CE as well as single-forcing sensitivity simulations of varying lengths. These results are from a fully-coupled, non-accelerated atmosphere-ocean-sea ice-land surface CCSM3 simulation at the T31_gx3 resolution. For the full TraCE simulation, the model is forced with transient greenhouse gas concentrations and orbitally-driven insolation changes. Transient boundary conditions include the ICE-5G ice sheets - extent and topography, and changing paleogeography as sea level rises from its Last Glacial Maximum low stand to modern levels. We also prescribe a transient scenario of meltwater forcing to the oceans from the retreating ice sheets. Vegetation is prognostic.
The following CCSM3 simulations are available:
[TraCE] full TraCE simulation, with transient forcing changes in greenhouse gases, orbitally-driven insolation variations, ice sheets and meltwater fluxes.
[TraCE-ORB] with only transient orbital forcing, all other forcings and boundary conditions remain at the full TraCE state of 22ka.
[TraCE-GHG] with only transient greenhouse gas forcing, all other forcings and boundary conditions remain at the full TraCE state of 22ka.
[TraCE-ICE] with only changing continental ice sheets, all other forcings and boundary conditions remain at the full TraCE state of 19ka.
[TraCE-MWF] with only transient Northern Hemisphere meltwater fluxes, all other forcings and boundary conditions remain at the full TraCE state of 19ka.
[TraCE-ORB-17ka] with only transient orbital forcing, all other forcings and boundary conditions remain at the full TraCE state of 17ka.
[TraCE-GHG-17ka] with only transient greenhouse gas forcing, all other forcings and boundary conditions remain at the full TraCE state of 17ka. </description>

    <title>MESACLIP: A 10-member ensemble of CESM HR RCP 8.5 (2006-2100) simulations</title>
    <description>Climate variations on seasonal-to-decadal (S2D) timescales can have enormous social, economic, and environmental impacts, making skillful predictions on these time scales an invaluable tool for policymakers and stakeholders. Such variations modulate the likelihood and intensity of extreme weather events including, tropical cyclones (TCs), heat waves, winter storms, atmospheric rivers (ARs), and floods, which have all been associated with (1) increases in human morbidity and mortality rates; (2) severe impacts on agriculture, energy use, and industrial activity; and (3) economic costs in the billions of dollars. Changes in prevailing climate patterns are also responsible for prolonged droughts, which can have profoundly negative effects on large segments of the world population. Enhancing our foreknowledge of climate variability on S2D time scales and understanding its influence on extreme weather events could help mitigate negative impacts on human and biological populations, making climate predictions an exceptionally important climate and social science frontier.
Over the past six years, our research team consisting of scientists at Texas A&amp;amp;M University (TAMU) and the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) has made major breakthroughs in advancing high-resolution global climate modeling and prediction. We have completed an unprecedented 10-member ensemble of Community Earth System Model (CESM) historical and future climate simulations at a tropical cyclone-permitting and ocean-eddy-rich resolution (hereafter simply referred to as CESM-HR). This CESM-HR ensemble was completed as part of our NSF-funded project entitled "Understanding the Role of MESoscale Atmosphere-Ocean Interactions in Seasonal-to-Decadal CLImate Prediction (MESACLIP)".   This ensemble is particularly timely, following the April 2023 report entitled "Extreme Weather Risk in a Changing Climate: Enhancing Prediction and Protecting Communities" from the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). Indeed, this report made several recommendations on how climate science can support the provision of information about future risks from extreme weather and highlight the urgent need for high-resolution simulations to improve predictions of extreme weather events and guide risk management strategies. More specifically, the report recognized that high-resolution simulations, in the range of 10 to 25 km horizontal resolution, would capture extreme events more accurately than typical low-resolution (approximately 100 km) climate projections, and it goes on to recommend "a focused federal effort to provide estimates of the risk that a weather event of a given severity will occur in any location and year between now and mid-century". Our 10-member CESM-HR ensemble is able to meet some of the key aspects of this PCAST report.
The CESM-HR configuration is based on an earlier CESM version, CESM1.3, with many additional modifications and improvements. CESM-HR uses a 0.25 degree grid in the atmosphere and land components and a 0.1 degree grid in the ocean and sea-ice components. The primary reason for using an older model version, instead of the latest CESM2, is that CESM2 does not support a high-resolution version per the decision by the CESM Scientific Steering Committee. The component models within CESM1.3 are the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5; Neale et al., 2012), the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2; Danabasoglu et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010), the Community Ice Code version 4 (CICE4; Hunke &amp;amp; Lipscomb, 2008), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4; Lawrence et al., 2011).
 The CESM-HR ensemble experimental design follows a similar approach as the CESM LENS1 large ensemble. We started with a 500-year preindustrial control (PI-CTRL) simulation forced by a perpetual climate forcing that corresponds to the year 1850 conditions. The first ensemble member is branched at year 250 of the PI-CTRL simulation and then integrated forward from year 1850 to 2100 (Figure 1). Ensemble members 2-10 are subsequently started from the year 1920 of ensemble member 1 and integrated forward to 2100 (Figure 1). Spread in the ensemble is generated by applying round-off level perturbations in the atmospheric potential temperature initial conditions for members 2-10. All 10 members use the same specified external climate forcing. Following the CMIP5 protocol for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments, historical forcing is used from 1920 to 2005 followed by the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) forcing from 2006 to 2100. RCP 8.5 is a high-emissions scenario and is frequently referred to as the "business as usual" scenario. It refers to the concentration of carbon that delivers global warming at an average of 8.5 W/m^2 across the planet by 2100. All 10 members produce a warming of approximately 4.5K at the end of 2100 in response to the applied historical and RCP 8.5 external forcing (Figure 1). The warming produced by CESM-HR is consistent with the warming from the standard low-resolution (approximately 1 degree) version of the model. The rate of warming simulated by CESM-HR over the observed period agrees very well with the observed rate of warming derived from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis (Figure 1).

    <title>North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program Data</title>
    <description>The North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP)
is a collection of regional climate model simulations downscaling global
simulations from CMIP3 to 50-km resolution over North America.  The
collection was generated in 2007-2012 with the goal of investigating
uncertainties in regional scale projections of future climate and
generating climate change scenarios for use in impacts research.

NARCCAP comprises a set 12 simulations from 6 RCMs downscaling 4 GCMs
using a fractional factorial design, plus 1 simulation from each RCM
downscaling the NCEP reanalysis, and 2 global atmosphere-only timeslice
experiments.  Historical data spans 1971-2000, and future data 2041-2070
using the SRES A2 emissions scenario.  It includes more than 3 dozen 2D
variables and a half-dozen 3D variables at 3-hourly frequencies, plus a
handful of static and daily variables.  All data is at 50-km spatial
resolution over a domain that covers most of North America and is stored
in CF-compliant netCDF files.

    <title>An Ensemble of Atmospheric Forcing Files from a CAM reanalysis</title>
    <description>
    This dataset contains files that are an ensemble of 'coupler history' files from an 80-member reanalysis performed with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) using the Community Atmosphere Model Version 4 with the finite volume core (CAM4 FV) at 1.9 degree by 2.5 degree resolution. The observations assimilated include all those used in the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (temperature and wind components from radiosondes, aircraft, and satellite drift winds) plus radio occultation observations from the COSMIC satellites starting in late 2006.  These files are intended to be used as 'DATM stream files' for CESM "I" component sets (land-only) that require a data atmosphere. Some example stream text files are included to illustrate how to use these data.
    
    
    Note:  All data were replaced for this dataset on January 27, 2020. There were some unphysical radiation values in the prior version of the dataset that has been fixed in the replacement file set. The unphysical radiation values caused CLM to error out but were likely not an issue for other applications.

    <title>Ensemble Historical Gridded Daily Temperature and Bias Adjusted Precipitation for Alaska and the Yukon</title>
    <description>Recently developed knowledge-based climatological interpolation and ensemble climatologically aided interpolation systems (Newman et al. 2019, 2020a) are used to develop gridded daily, 2 km grid spacing ensemble historical observations across Alaska and the Yukon territory. The ensemble files include daily unadjusted and adjusted precipitation (mm/day), daily mean temperature (degree C), diurnal temperature range (degree C), fraction of precipitation falling as snow, and the wetting loss and wind undercatch correction factors (Newman et al. 2020b). Currently there are only two deterministic daily gridded primarily in situ based observational datasets for this region. This dataset is the novel for the region because it is an ensemble and it contains ensemble estimates of gauge loss corrected precipitation. Additionally, there are limitations with any of the available observation based products, and having another comparison point is useful to the community.</description>

    <title>Datasets used in Bacmeister et al,  JAMES (2020). " CO2 increase experiments ..."</title>
    <description>Datasets used in the creation of original figures of Bacmeister et al. JAMES (2020). CO2 increase experiments using the Community Earth System Model (CESM): Relationship to climate sensitivity and comparison of CESM1 to CESM2.
We examine the response of the Community Earth System Model versions 1 and 2 (CESM1 and CESM2) to abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations (4xCO2) and to 1% annually increasing CO2 concentrations (1% CO2). Different estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) for CESM1 and CESM2 are presented. All estimates show that the sensitivity of CESM2 has increased by 1.5K or more over that of CESM1. At the same time the transient climate response (TCR) of CESM1 and CESM2 derived from 1% CO2 experiments has not changed significantly - 2.1K in CESM1 and 2.0K in CESM2. Increased initial forcing as well as stronger shortwave radiation feedbacks are responsible for the increase in ECS seen in CESM2. A decomposition of regional radiation feedbacks and their contribution to global feedbacks shows that the Southern Ocean plays a key role in the overall behavior of 4xCO2 experiments, accounting for about 50% of the total shortwave feedback in both CESM1 and CESM2. The Southern Ocean is also responsible for around half of the increase in shortwave feedback between CESM1 and CESM2, with a comparable contribution arising over tropical ocean. Experiments using a thermodynamic slab-ocean model (SOM) yield estimates of ECS that are in remarkable agreement with those from fully-coupled earth system model (ESM) experiments for the same level of CO2 increase. Finally, we show that the similarity of TCR in CESM1 and CESM2 masks significant regional differences in warming that occur in the 1% CO2 experiments for each model.</description>

    <title>Comparison of CAMS and CMAQ analyses of surface-level PM2.5 and O3 over the conterminous United States (CONUS)</title>
    <description>In this study, we compare the performance of the analysis time series over the period of August 2020 to December 2021 at EPA AirNow stations for both PM2.5 and O3 from raw Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) reanalyses (CAMS RA Raw), raw CAMS near real-time forecasts (CAMS FC Raw), raw near real-time Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) forecasts (CMAQ FC Raw), bias-corrected CAMS forecasts (CAMS FC BC), and bias-corrected CMAQ forecasts (CMAQ FC BC). This 17-month period spans two wildfire seasons, to assess model analysis performance in high-end AQ events. In addition to determining the best-performing gridded product, this process allows us to benchmark the performance of CMAQ forecasts against other global datasets (CAMS reanalysis and forecasts). For both PM2.5 and O3, the bias correction algorithm employed here greatly improved upon the raw model time series, and CMAQ FC BC was the best-performing model analysis time series, having the lowest RMSE, smallest bias error, and largest critical success index at multiple thresholds.</description>

    <title>Climate Change in the Thermosphere and Ionosphere from the Early Twentieth Century to Early Twenty-First Century Simulated by the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model - eXtended</title>
    <description>Motivated by numerous lower atmosphere climate model hindcast simulations, we performed simulations of the earth's atmosphere from the surface up through the thermosphere-ionosphere to reveal for the first time the century scale changes in the upper atmosphere from the 1920s through the 2010s using the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model - eXtended (WACCM-X v. 2.1). We impose solar minimum conditions to get a clear indication of the effects of the long-term forcing from greenhouse gas increases and changes of the Earth's magnetic field and to avoid the requirement for careful removal of the 11-year solar cycle as in some previous studies using observations and models. These previous studies have shown greenhouse gas effects in the upper atmosphere but what has been missing is the time evolution with actual greenhouse gas increases throughout the last century, including the period of less than 5% increase prior to the space age and the transition to the over 25% increase in the latter half of the 20th century. Neutral temperature, density, and ionosphere changes are close to those reported in previous studies, and we find a high correlation of continuous changes over this past century between carbon dioxide and thermosphere neutral temperature due the shorter adjustment time of the upper atmosphere to greenhouse gas changes relative to the years to decades in the lower atmosphere. Consequently, WACCM-X future projections can provide valuable insight into what is to come in the entire atmosphere under future scenarios of greenhouse gas changes and mitigation efforts.
The model output covers the first 6 years of each decade from the 1920s to the 2010s. The horizontal resolution is 1.9 x 2.5 latitude x longitude and 1/4 scale height in the vertical.</description>

    <title>Stratospheric chlorine processing after the unprecedented Hunga Tonga eruption</title>
    <description>Following the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) eruption in January 2022, a significant reduction in stratospheric hydrochloric acid (HCl) was observed in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes during the latter half of 2022, suggesting potential chlorine activation. The objective of this study is to comprehensively understand the substantial loss of HCl in the aftermath of HTHH. Satellite measurements along with a global chemistry-climate model are employed for the analysis. We find strong agreement of 2022 anomalies between the modeled and the measured data. The observed tracer-tracer relations between N2O and HCl indicate a significant role of chemical processing in the observed HCl reduction, especially during the austral winter of 2022. Further examining the roles of chlorine gas-phase and heterogeneous chemistry, we find that heterogeneous chemistry emerges as the primary driver for the chemical loss of HCl, with the reaction between HOBr and HCl on sulfate aerosols identified as the dominant loss process.
This datasets provide basis of our analysis in the paper - Chemistry contribution to stratospheric ozone depletion after the unprecedented water-rich Hunga Tonga eruption. The numerical experiments in this study were conducted using CESM2/WACCM6, a state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model that spans from the Earth's surface to approximately 140 km.
We run two different nudged cases: the volcano case with forcing (SO2 and H2O injection) from the HTHH eruption and the control case with no forcing (no SO2 or H2O injection) from the HTHH eruption. The disparity between these two nudged simulations provides insights into the chemistry-related changes post the HTHH eruption. Only the datasets used in analysis are archived here.
We also archive our box model used in the analysis here. This is a single layer lower stratospheric chemical equilibrium box model setup for Hunga Tonga experiments.</description>

    <title>Marine cloud brightening climate intervention is simulated by CESM2 under a susceptibility-based strategy under SSP2-4.5</title>
    <description>The efficiency of marine cloud brightening in cooling Earth's surface temperature is investigated by using a medium ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). Various cloud seeding schemes based on susceptibility are examined to determine what area extent will be required to induce 1.5 degrees C cooling under SSP2-4.5. The results indicate that cloud seeding over 5% of the ocean area is capable of achieving this goal. Under this seeding scheme, cloud seeding is mainly deployed over lower latitudes where strong surface temperature and precipitation responses are induced. The simulations also reveal that the 5% cloud seeding scheme reduces precipitation over the ocean, but enhances precipitation over land, with an overall reduction in global precipitation.
    Previous modeling studies indicate that even though marine cloud brightening under a susceptibility-based strategy is effective in reducing the global average surface temperature, it can induce several highly undesirable outcomes. Under such marine cloud brightening intervention, a La Nina-like sea-surface temperature response is triggered with cooling mostly confined within lower latitudes. It is likely to pose a threat to disrupt the El Nino Southern Oscillation.
    A different cloud seeding strategy is explored to alleviate such undesirable outcomes. It is hypothesized that deployment of marine cloud brightening over broader regions with low susceptibility to cloud seeding might induce cooling more evenly distributed over the globe, and hence exert much weaker regional forcing on the climate system. This hypothesis is tested with the Community Earth System Model, version 2 (CESM2). Our simulations with CESM2 reveal that this new strategy indeed alleviates the highly undesirable outcomes previously found.
    The CESM2 SSP2-4.5 ensemble simulations can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.26024/j23t-pc83.</description>

    <title>CESM2 Perfect Model Prediction Ensembles, 2030</title>
    <description>This dataset includes ensemble prediction experiments using the CESM2 model. These are "perfect model prediction experiments" in which the simulations are initialized with nearly identical conditions from CESM2 simulations in the year 2030 and then integrated forward for two years. Ensemble prediction sets are initialized on January 1, March 1, May 1, July 1, September 1, and November 1. Five different initial conditions, taken from five different CESM2 simulations, are used for each initialization timing and 15 members are simulated for each of the five initial states. These 15 members differ with a micro-perturbation to the initial atmospheric temperature. Thus, for each initialization timing set (i.e. January 1, 2030) there are 75 total ensemble members (15 members for 5 initial states). These experiments can be used to assess the inherent initial-value predictability characteristics of the earth system as simulated by CESM2.</description>

    <title>CAM-chem simulation of the 2020 lockdown</title>
    <description> With the reduction in economic activities following the COVID19 pandemic outbreak in early 2020, most emissions of air pollutants (i.e., nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), volatile organic carbon (VOC), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC)) have decreased substantially during several months in different regions of the world. This unintended global experiment has given insight on some of the processes that control air quality and offered a glimpse into a potential future in which air quality would be improved. Here, a global atmospheric model is used to assess the changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere during the pandemic period and in the related chemical processes that lead to the formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA).

The chemical fields made available here are provided by the Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 2.2 that accounts for interactive physical, chemical and dynamical processes. The simulations are performed with a detailed chemical scheme (MOZART TS1 mechanism) driven by emission changes of primary pollutants and forced by realistic weather conditions reproduce reasonably well the changes observed in the chemical composition of the atmosphere, and specifically in the perturbations of surface ozone and other oxidants during the COVID19 pandemic. Two simulations are made available, a reference using daily emissions for 2020 and another one that includes the lockdown induced emission changes.</description>

    <description> We analyze two preindustrial experiments from the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) to characterize the impact of sea ice physics on differences in coastal sea ice production around Antarctica and the resulting impact on the ocean and atmosphere. The only difference between the two experiments is the selection of the thermodynamic formulation, by changing the KTHERM namelist parameter. We find substantial differences in the dominant sea ice physical processes, ocean water mass formation, ocean circulation, and coastal atmosphere.</description>

    <title>Data for Exploring the Relative Contribution of the MJO and ENSO to Mid-latitude Subseasonal Predictability</title>
    <description>Here we explore the relative contribution of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to mid-latitude subseasonal predictive skill of upper atmospheric circulation over the North Pacific, using an inherently interpretable neural network applied to pre-industrial control runs of the Community Earth System Model version 2. We find that this interpretable network generally favors the state of ENSO, rather than the MJO, to make correct predictions on a range of subseasonal lead times and predictand averaging windows. Moreover, the predictability of positive circulation anomalies over the North Pacific is comparatively lower than that of their negative counterparts, especially evident when the ENSO state is important. However, when ENSO is in a neutral state, our findings indicate that the MJO provides some predictive information, particularly for positive anomalies. We identify three distinct evolutions of these MJO states, offering fresh insights into opportune forecasting windows for MJO teleconnections.</description>

    <title>Result of Assimilating Ground-Based MLT Winds into WACCM</title>
    <description>This dataset contains the outputs from
assimilating MLT wind observations from ground-based Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) and meteor radar networks into the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) using the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). Two Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) were conducted for the 2018/2019 Northern Hemisphere winter. In the first OSSE, Experiment 09, synthetic observations of lower atmospheric state variables and SABER and MLS neutral temperatures are assimilated. In the second OSSE, Experiment 10, additional synthetic ground-based MLT wind measurements were assimilated to assess their added value. An older version of the Experiment 08 has been deprecated. If access to Experiment 08 is needed please contact GDEX team.
The data includes the hourly output of the ensemble mean of prior neutral temperature, neutral zonal wind, and neutral meridional wind as well as the synthetic observation files.</description>

    <title>CESM2 Initialized 2019/20 Australian Wildfire Simulations</title>
    <description> The coupled climate response to biomass burning emissions from the 2019/20 Australian wildfire season is estimated from the contrast between this 30-member ensembles using CESM2 initialized in August 2019. In response to the fires, a widespread increase in biomass aerosol burdens is simulated in the southern hemisphere through late 2019 and early 2020. Accompanying the increase is an enhancement of cloud albedo, particularly in regions of widespread stratocumulus clouds in the southeastern subtropical Pacific Ocean. The increase in albedo acts to cool the surface, dry the boundary layer, and reduce the moist static energy of the advected low-level flow into the deep tropics. It also cools the ocean locally and the currents that flow into the deep tropics. In response, the Intertropical Convergence Zone is found to migrate northward and sea surface temperature in the Nino 3. 4 region cools. A subsequent multi-year ensemble-mean cooling of the tropical Pacific is simulated through the end of 2021, suggesting an important contribution to the ongoing strong La Nina event.</description>

    <title>CTSM (CLM5) CAMELS Basins Model -- LSE calibration version 1</title>
    <description>This dataset contains the first public configuration of the CTSM land model designed for experimentation on CTSM hydrologic processes, including runoff. It contains the model implementation spanning a large-sample collection of 627 watersheds from the CAMELS dataset, also developed at NCAR. This archive contains the input, configuration and output files constructed to introduce a new model parameter estimation approach using AI-based model emulators with sequential optimization to calibrate and regionalize CTSM (and other models) for large-domain (national to global scale) implementation. This data resource (together with the public LSE method repository at NCAR) forms a valuable testbed for hydrologic modeling with CTSM will enable the community to explore and build on the new approach, and provides a benchmark for evaluating future modeling strategies for hydrology. It also contains a large sample (of up to 1000 parameter sets per basin) for assessment of CTSM hydrologic parameter sensitivities.
The data are not grids but are mostly time-series of locations that enable the implementation of CTSM over 627 individual watersheds, treated individually as points.</description>

    <description>Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) Tier 2 Climate Change High Resolution developer catalogues. Each ARTMIP method/algorithm (named by the developer) submits a catalogue comprised of 0's (no AR exists) or 1's (yes AR exists) for each time slice, for each grid point, using a curated set of climate change AMIP style output from the Community Atmosphere Model's finite-volume dynamical core version at 25 km horizontal resolution, which was run by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Catalogues were created for three historical (All-Hist) ensemble members (run002: 1979 to 2005, run006: 1995 to 2005, run008: 1995 to 2005) and two RCP 8.5 (PlusRCP85) ensemble members (run001: 2079 to 2099, run002: 2079 to 2084). Derived quantities required for algorithms, such as IVT or IWV, were computed by the ARTMIP project so that all methods use the same data. </description>

    <title>CESM2 SMYLE</title>
    <description>SMYLE (Seasonal-to-MultiYear Large Ensemble) is an initialized prediction system using CESM2. It consists of fully coupled initialized hindcast simulations using CESM2 component models at nominal 1 degree horizontal resolution. Hindcasts are initialized from historical reconstructions (SMYLE-FOSI for ocean and sea-ice; SMYLE-landonly for land; and JRA55 reanalysis for atmosphere) and then integrated forward 24-months. Initialization occurs quarterly (1st of each month of February, May, August, and November) for each year between 1970-2019. The ensemble size is 20 for each start date, with ensemble spread introduced through a random field perturbation applied to the atmospheric initial conditions. The SMYLE data release also includes the historical reconstructions used to initialize the ocean, sea ice, ocean biogeochemistry, and land components (SMYLE-FOSI and SMYLE-landonly).</description>

    <title>NOAA/CIRES Twentieth Century Global Reanalysis Version 2c</title>
    <description>
        The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project, produced by the Earth System Research Laboratory Physical Sciences Division from NOAA and the University of Colorado Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, is an effort to produce a global reanalysis dataset spanning a portion of the nineteenth century and the entire twentieth century (1851 - near present), assimilating only surface observations of synoptic pressure. Boundary conditions of pentad sea surface temperature and monthly sea ice concentration and time-varying solar, volcanic, and carbon dioxide radiative forcings are prescribed. Products include 6-hourly ensemble mean and spread analysis fields on a 2 by 2 degree global latitude-longitude grid, and 3 and 6-hourly ensemble mean and spread forecast (first guess) fields on a global Gaussian T62 grid. Fields are accessible in yearly time series (1 file per parameter) and monthly synoptic time (all parameters per synoptic hour) files.  This dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability spanning 1851 to 2012 at six-hourly resolution. Fields from 1851 to 1860 are a first attempt at this period and will be improved in future versions. Fields from 1861 to 2011 are most relevant for climate and weather studies. 
        
        
        20th Century Reanalysis Version 2c uses the same model as version 2 with new sea ice boundary conditions from the COBE-SST2 (Hirahara et al. 2014), new pentad Simple Ocean Data Assimilation with sparse input (SODAsi.2, Giese et al. 2015) sea surface temperature fields from through 2012, Daily High-Resolution-Blended Analyses for Sea Surface Temperature starting with 2013, and additional observations from ISPD version 3.2.9.
        
        
        
        A low pressure bias in marine pressures from the US Maury Collection (Woodruff et al. 2005, Wallbrink et al. 2009, ) appears to have affected the resultant 20CR version 2c mass-related fields (e.g., pressure, geopotential height) from 1851 to about 1865. Please see opportunities for improvement for additional information.
        
        
        
        The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project version 2c used resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center managed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231. Version 2c is a contribution to the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative. Support for the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project is provided by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science (BER) and the NOAA Climate Program Office MAPP program.

    <title>CORE.2 Global Air-Sea Flux Dataset</title>
    <description>
    
    This dataset contains the complete set of global air-sea heat and water flux components computed from version 2 of CORE (Common Ocean Reference Experiment) atmospheric state fields starting from 1949.
    
    
    The air-sea fluxes are derived from bulk formulae applied to atmospheric state fields from multiple sources together with a merged Hadley-OI SST product at monthly resolution. The primary atmospheric input data are based on NCEP reanalyses at 6-hourly resolution. In addition, satellite-based radiation, precipitation, and sea ice concentration are used, at resolutions from daily to monthly. Some of the input data have been adjusted to agree in the mean with a variety of more reliable satellite and in situ measurements that themselves are either too short in duration or too regional in coverage. Fluxes have been temporally averaged as needed for distribution as monthly means.

    <title>CLM land-only release (using CLM4.0, 4.5, 5.0)</title>
    <description>These data are from a series of simulations documenting model developments that have been included in Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) which is the default land component for the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). These data were generated to compare CLM5 to prior versions of CLM (CLM4 and CLM4.5) in land-only mode forced with several historical forcing datasets including GSWP3v1, CRUNCEPv7, and WATCH. Data include simulations with LAI prescribed from satellite phenology (SP) and simulations with prognostic vegetation state and active biogeochemistry (BGC). All simulations were completed at a resolution of 0.9 degrees latitude by 1.25 degrees longitude. Additional simulations were conducted to evaluate model sensitivities to land use and land cover change, active crop management, elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2, and nitrogen enrichment. Raw data were post processed to generate single variable time series. In addition to standard monthly output, these data also include PFT-level, daily, and hourly data available for selected fields and simulations. Additional analyses were made using the CLM diagnostics package and International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) package and available at the linked web sites.</description>

    <title>Ensemble Dressing of North American Land Data Assimilation version 2 (EDN2)</title>
    <description>Most datasets of surface meteorology are deterministic, yet many applications using these datasets require or can benefit from uncertainty estimates in meteorological fields. Motivated by this gap, we applied a locally-weighted spatial regression technique with the widely-used North American Land Data Assimilation version 2 (NLDAS-2) dataset values to generate ensemble estimates for daily precipitation, daily mean temperature, and diurnal temperature range. The approach is a form of ensemble dressing. This uncertainty dataset and methods from this work are made publicly available to support research such a data assimilation or model uncertainty studies.
    The dataset includes a 100-member ensemble for daily precipitation, temperature and diurnal temperature range at 1/8th degree for the NLDAS-2 domain (25 to 53 North, 125 to 67 West), for the time period 1979-2019. It also includes the spatial regression coefficients and other inputs needed to run the Gridded Meteorological Ensemble Tool (GMET) used to generate the ensembles. A limited number of summary statistical analyses of the dataset are also included.</description>

    <title>Cloud-Modified CESM1 Historical and RCP8.5 5-Member Ensemble</title>
    <description>The relative importance of radiative feedbacks and emissions scenarios in controlling surface warming patterns is challenging to quantify across model generations. We analyze three variants of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with differing equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECS) under identical CMIP5 historical and high-emissions scenarios. CESM1, our base model, exhibits Arctic-amplified warming with the least warming in the Southern Hemisphere middle latitudes. A variant of CESM1 with enhanced extratropical shortwave cloud feedbacks shows slightly increased late-21st Century warming at all latitudes. In the next-generation model, CESM2, global-mean warming is also slightly greater, but the warming is zonally redistributed in a pattern mirroring cloud and surface albedo feedbacks. However, if the nominally equivalent CMIP6 scenario is applied to CESM2, the redistributed warming pattern is preserved, but global-mean warming is significantly greater. These results demonstrate how model structural differences and scenario differences combine to produce differences in climate projections across model generations.</description>

    <title>Aquaplanet simulations using the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) version 6.2</title>
    <description>This dataset includes model output from aquaplanet simulations using the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS), version 6.2. Aquaplanet simulations are numerical simulations on an Earth-like water-covered surface without land, topography, sea-ice, or seasons. These simulations are useful for studying climate and weather in a simplified yet realistic framework. The specific simulations contained in this dataset were produced using MPAS, which is an NCAR-supported community model. Various simulations were produced with variations to either the horizontal grid spacing, vertical grid spacing, or physics packages used. Model output from each simulation was interpolated to a 1-degree by 1-degree latitude-by-longitude grid and 17 vertical levels of constant pressure (e.g., isobaric levels). Most of the simulations cover a three-year period, and three simulations cover a two-year period. Details of the simulations and their comparison against other datasets will be documented in a manuscript to be submitted to the Journal of Advancements in Modeling Earth Systems Science. As required by the journal, the dataset will be made available to the public without restrictions.</description>

    <title>CESM2 Large Ensemble</title>
    <description>The CESM2 Large Ensemble consists of 100 members at 1 degree spatial resolution covering the period 1850-2100 under CMIP6 historical and SSP370 future radiative forcing scenarios. Two separate sets of biomass burning emissions forcing files were used within the ensemble. Members 1-50 were forced with CMIP6 protocols identical to those used in Danabasoglu et al. (2020) in the paper for CESM2. For members 51-100, the most relevant species for biomass burning fluxes from the CMIP6 protocols were smoothed with an 11-year running mean filter, impacting the fluxes over the years 1990-2020.
The CESM2 Large Ensemble uses a combination of different oceanic and atmospheric initial states to create ensemble spread as follows: 
Members 1-10: These begin from years 1001, 1021, 1041, 1061, 1081, 1101, 1121, 1141, 1161, and 1181 of the 1400-year pre-industrial control simulation. This segment of the control simulation was chosen to minimize drift.
Members 11-90: These begin from 4 pre-selected years of the pre-industrial control simulation based on the phase of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). For each of the 4 initial states, there are 20 ensemble members created by randomly perturbing the atmospheric temperature field on the order of -14K. The chosen start dates (model years 1231, 1251, 1281, and 1301) sample AMOC and Sea Surface Height (SSH) in the Labrador Sea at their maximum, minimum and transition states.
Members 91-100: These begin from years 1011, 1031, 1051, 1071, 1091, 1111, 1131, 1151, 1171, and 1191 of the 1400-year pre-industrial control simulation. This set includes the extensive "MOAR" output, which can be used to drive regional climate models.
The initialization design allows assessment of oceanic (AMOC) and atmospheric contributions to ensemble spread, and the impact of AMOC initial-condition memory on the global earth system.</description>

    <title>Efficient Drift Correction of Initialized Earth System Predictions</title>
    <description>Ensemble Earth system model predictions initialized from states close to observations generally drift away from observed climatology and towards a biased model climatology over timescales from days to years. Estimation of drift, the change in forecast climatology with lead time, is essential for computing forecast anomalies that can be meaningfully compared with observed anomalies from the past and used with confidence to credibly anticipate weather pattern changes from weeks to decades in advance. Conventional methods for estimating drift rely on the availability of a large sample of reforecasts spanning at least two decades, but generating such comprehensive reforecast sets requires a significant investment of both human and computer resources. We show here that subseasonal to decadal forecast drift can be well estimated using minimal reforecast methods that target a predetermined climatological window, yielding forecast anomaly and skill verification metrics that closely match those obtained using standard (much more expensive) methods. Efficient and accurate forecast drift quantification facilitates prediction system experimentation with greatly reduced overhead. </description>

    <title>A Suite of Perturbed Parameter Ensembles using CESM2.2 CAM6 under a Wide Range of Temperatures</title>
    <description>This dataset originates from a new CESM2 CAM6 perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) designed to explore climate and hydroclimate dynamics under a wide range of sea surface temperature (SST) conditions. The SST varies from 4 degrees Celsius colder to 16 degrees Celsius warmer than preindustrial levels, encompassing a broad spectrum of mean temperatures spanning the past 65 million years. This dataset offers valuable insights into climate and hydroclimate responses, as well as weather and climate extremes under diverse conditions. 
The dataset includes results from nine PPE simulations with different SST scenarios: preindustrial (PREI), 4K cooler (M04K), and 4K, 8K, 12K, and 16K warmer (P04K to P16K). For SSTs exceeding 8K warming, sea ice was removed to improve numerical stability. Each PPE set consists of 250 ensemble members, with 45 parameters related to microphysics, convection, turbulence, and aerosols perturbed using Latin Hypercube Sampling. An additional simulation with default parameter settings brings the total to 251 simulations, each running for five years using CAM6.3 (https://github.com/ESCOMP/CAM/tree/cam6_3_026; with additional paleo modifications).
Post-processing converted the data into compressed NetCDF-4 format. All 251 runs were concatenated using ncecat to minimize the number of files. For example, the following file contains monthly surface temperature data from the preindustrial PPE:
f.c6.F1850.f19_f19.paleo_ppe.sst_prei.ens251/atm/proc/tseries/month_1/f.c6.F1850.f19_f19.paleo_ppe.sst_prei.ens251.cam.h0.TS.000101-000512.nc
A detailed variable list can be found in the Documentation Tab.
Parameter values are provided in the PPE Parameter File. More details can be found in the paper: Zhu et al. (2025). Investigating the State Dependence of Cloud Feedback Using a Suite of Perturbed Parameter Ensembles, Journal of Climate.</description>

    <title>Gridded Ensemble Precipitation and Temperature Estimates over the Contiguous United States Version 2.0</title>
    <description>Gridded precipitation and temperature products are inherently uncertain due to myriad factors, including interpolation from a sparse observation network, measurement representativeness, and measurement errors. Generally uncertainty is not explicitly accounted for in gridded products of precipitation or temperature; if it is represented, it is often included in an ad-hoc manner. A lack of quantitative uncertainty estimates for hydrometeorological forcing fields limits the application of advanced data assimilation systems and other analysis tools in land-surface and hydrologic modeling.

This study develops a gridded, observation-based ensemble of precipitation and temperature at a daily increment for the period 1980-2012. This allows for the estimation of precipitation and temperature uncertainty in hydrologic modeling and data assimilation through the use of the ensemble variance. Statistical verification of the ensemble indicates that it has generally good reliability and discrimination of events of various magnitudes, but has a slight wet bias for high threshold events (&gt; 50 mm). The ensemble mean is similar to another widely used hydrometeorological dataset but with some important differences. The ensemble product produces more realistic occurrence of precipitation statistics (wet day fraction), which impacts the empirical derivation of other fields used in land-surface and hydrologic modeling. Elevation lapse rates for temperature are derived directly from the observations, resulting in higher winter temperatures at high elevations in the intermountain western US.</description>

    <title>CESM2 Perfect Model Predictions for 2010</title>
    <description>This dataset includes ensemble prediction experiments using the CESM2 model. These are "perfect model prediction experiments" in which the simulations are initialized with nearly identical conditions from CESM2 historical simulations in the year 2010 and then integrated forward for two years. Ensemble prediction sets are initialized on January 1, March 1, May 1, July 1, September 1, and November 1. Five different initial conditions, taken from five different CESM2 historical simulations, are used are each initialization timing and 15 members are simulated for each of the five initial states. These 15 members differ with a micro-perturbation to the initial atmospheric temperature. Thus, for each initialization timing set (i.e. January 1, 2010) there are 75 total ensemble members (15 members for 5 initial states). These experiments can be used to assess the inherent initial-value predictability characteristics of the earth system as simulated by CESM2. </description>

    <title>CESM2 83-level simulations</title>
    <description>In the next generation of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM7), the model top will be raised and the vertical resolution will be increased. The model top will be approximately 80 km (compared to 40 km in older generations), and the grid spacing in the free troposphere and lower stratosphere will be reduced to about 500 m compared to around 1137m in older generations. In addition to this, extra levels will be added to the boundary layer and the lowest model level will be lowered. Overall, this "mid-top" version of CAM7 will have 93 levels. However, many other changes will also be present in CAM7 such as physics updates and the new spectral element dynamical core, making it challenging to identify the role of this enhanced resolution in changes between CAM7 and CAM6.
    This dataset consists of a suite of simulations that use CAM6 physics and the finite volume dynamical core, but with CAM7's grid except for the changes to the levels in the boundary layer i.e., an 83 level model. The boundary layer levels are not changed because once those are changed, some additional tuning of the physical parameterizations is needed precluding a clean comparison and identification of the impact of vertical resolution. Only minimal changes to CAM6 physics have been applied to these simulations; the non-orographic gravity wave drag scheme was turned on, the upper boundary condition was changed such that any remaining gravity wave momentum flux is deposited at the model lid, and some minor tuning of the gravity wave drag settings was also performed to optimize the behavior of the QBO. These simulations can, therefore, be compared with existing CAM6 simulations to identify the impacts of this raising of the model lid and change to the resolution of the free troposphere and lower stratosphere. These simulations have an internally generated QBO and a relatively good representation of the stratospheric polar vortices and can be used to explore climate variability and change in the presence of those features.</description>

    <description>Two atmosphere-only experiments using CAM5,  PAC-A and extSPCZ-A (each with 10 ensemble members), are conducted to compare with the fully coupled CESM1 tropical Pacific pacemaker (PAC-C) experiments. The uncoupled PAC-A experiment matches the coupled PAC-C in every way, apart from the inclusion of coupling outside of the tropical Pacific region. In this way, the PAC-A ensemble mean with external forcing removed (i.e., PAC-A minus LENS) isolates the direct atmospheric influence of tropical Pacific SST. In other words, the uncoupled PAC-A and coupled PAC-C simulations enable an "apple-to-apple " comparison to identify the tropical Pacific SST influence on global SST and atmospheric teleconnections.</description>

    <description>Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) Tier 2 CMIP5/6 developer catalogues and source data. Each ARTMIP method/algorithm (named by developer) submits a catalogue comprised of 0's (no AR exists) or 1's (yes AR exists) for each time slice, for each grid point, using a curated set of output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 and 6 multi-model ensembles (see Table 1). Catalogues are created for single ensemble members from historical simulations and for RCP8.5 (CMIP5) and SSP5-8.5 (CMIP6) future simulations, for the 1950-2099 time period. Ensemble member r1i1p1f1 or r1i1p1f1 is used for each input, with the exception of the CMIP5 CCSM4 run, which uses ensemble member r6i1p1. Derived CMIP5/6 quantities required for algorithms, such as IVT or IWV, were computed by the ARTMIP project so that all methods use the exact same data.
    There are some exceptions to the time period noted above: output from the CMIP6 IPSL-CM6A-LR SSP5-8.5 simulation are only available through 2049, there are data corruption issues for the year 2006 in the CMIP5 CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 simulation, and there are data corruption issues for the year 2095-2099 for the TECA_BARD_v1.0 output applied to the CMIP5 IPSL-CM5B-LR simulation. The Guan_Waliser_v2 algorithm did not supply ARDT catalogues for the NorESM1-M and BCC-CSM2-MR simulations. </description>

    <title>CESM1 CAM5 BGC Medium Ensemble</title>
    <description>There is growing evidence that the role internal variability plays in our confidence in future climate projections has been under-appreciated in past assessments of model projections for the coming decades. In light of this, a 15 member ensemble has been produced to complement the existing 30 member "Large Ensemble" conducted with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). In contrast to the Large Ensemble, which explored the variability in RCP8.5, our new ensemble uses the moderate mitigation scenario represented by RCP4.5. By comparing outputs from these two ensembles, we assess at what point in the future the climates conditioned on the two scenarios will begin to significantly diverge. We find in general that while internal variability is a significant component of uncertainty for periods before 2050, there is evidence of a significantly increased risk of extreme warm events in some regions as early as 2030 in RCP8.5 relative to RCP4.5. Furthermore, the period 2061-2080 sees largely separate joint distributions of annual mean temperature and precipitation in most regions for the two ensembles. Hence, in the CESM's representation of the Earth System for the latter portion of the 21st century, the range of climatic states which might be expected in the RCP8.5 scenario is significantly and detectably further removed from today's climate state than the RCP4.5 scenario even in the presence of internal variability.</description>

    <title>iPOGS: A 10-member ensemble of CESM HR RCP 6.0 (2006-2100) simulations</title>
    <description>Current predictions and projections of future sea-level changes are based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) class climate model simulations. Although this class of models is capable of simulating global sea-level rise and its basic spatial patterns, they are unable to robustly and accurately predict or project future regional and local sea-level changes because of their limitations in representing complex coastline and bathymetry features and regional ocean circulations with their coarse (approximately 100 km) horizontal resolutions. More specifically, sea-level changes within the Gulf of Mexico are closely linked to changes in the Loop Current and its eddies, which cannot be resolved by these CMIP-class models. 
    
To address this fundamental issue, we have completed a 10-member ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) at a Tropical Cyclone-permitting and ocean-mesoscale-eddy-rich horizontal resolution (hereafter simply referred to as CESM-HR). The CESM-HR configuration is based on an earlier CESM version, CESM1.3, with many additional modifications and improvements. CESM-HR uses a 0.25 degree grid in the atmosphere and land components and a 0.1 degree grid in the ocean and sea-ice components. The primary reason for using an older model version, instead of the latest CESM2, is that CESM2 does not support a high-resolution version per the decision by the CESM Scientific Steering Committee. The component models within CESM1.3 are the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5; Neale et al., 2012), the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2; Danabasoglu et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010), the Community Ice Code version 4 (CICE4; Hunke and Lipscomb, 2008), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4; Lawrence et al., 2011).
                            
Following the protocol for the CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments, the representative concentration pathway 6.0 (RCP 6.0) was used to force the model from 2006 to 2100. RCP 6.0 represents a stabilization scenario, where the greenhouse gas emission rate is high initially, but total radiative forcing is stabilized after 2100 through the use of various technologies and strategies for reducing emissions. In this scenario, the specified amount of carbon concentration results in an average global radiative forcing increase of 6.0 W/m^2 by 2100. This CESM-HR ensemble was completed as part of our National Academy of Sciences (NAS) funded project entitled "Improving Prediction and Projection of Gulf of Mexico Sea-Level Changes Using Eddy-Resolving Earth System Models (iPOGS)". This effort is complementary to the 10-member ensemble of CESM-HR historical and future (with RCP 8.5 forcing) climate simulations produced by our National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project entitled "Understanding the role of mesoscale atmosphere-ocean interactions in seasonal-to-decadal climate prediction (MESACLIP)". Each RCP 6.0 simulation starts at the end of the corresponding historical simulation from MESACLIP, enabling the exploration of future projections associated with varying levels of mitigation and future greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Figure 1 shows the global-mean dynamical sea level (DSL) from simulations under different forcings. The stronger warming associated with the RCP 8.5 forcing results in an additional 10 cm rise in global-mean DSL by 2100 compared to that of the RCP 6.0 ensemble.

    <title>Hourly WRF-Chem simulation with SMAP soil moisture insertion over the Contiguous U.S. for the period 2015 - 2019</title>
    <description>Continuous multi year WRF-Chem simulation (2015 - 2019) over the contiguous U.S. at 9 km grid spacing. Initial and boundary conditions are from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). Aerosol processes are represented with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model. Atmospheric chemistry is not explicitly resolved. We use gas climatologies to produce sulfate aerosols. Aerosol emissions from fires are represented with the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) version 2.5 whereas anthropogenic emissions are based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Emissions Inventory (NEI). Sea salt emissions are accounted for by the GOCART emissions. The mineral dust emissions use the GOCART model with the Air Force Weather Agency extensions (GOCART-AFWA). Soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission were inserted every 12 hours starting on April 1 2015.</description>

    <title>Effects of model resolution, physics, and coupling on Southern Hemisphere storm tracks in CESM1.3</title>
    <description>Two high-resolution versions of a coupled Earth system model (CESM1.3: 0.25 degree atmosphere, 1 degree ocean; CESM1.1: 0.25 degree atmosphere, 0.1 degree ocean) are compared to the standard resolution CESM1.1 and CESM1.3 (1 degree atmosphere, 1 degree ocean). The CESM1.3 versions are documented, and the consequences of model resolution, air-sea coupling, and physics in the atmospheric models are studied with regards to storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere as represented by 850 hPa eddy kinetic energy. Increasing the resolution from 1 degree to 0.25 degree in the atmosphere (same physics) coupled to the 1 degree ocean intensifies the strength of the storm tracks closer to observations. The 0.25 degree atmosphere with the older CESM1.1 physics coupled to the 0.1 degree ocean has fewer low clouds, warmer Southern Ocean SSTs, a weaker meridional temperature gradient, and a degraded storm track simulation compared to the 0.25 degree atmosphere with CESM1.3 physics coupled to the 1 degree ocean. Therefore, deficient physics in the atmospheric model can negate the gains attained by higher resolution in atmosphere and ocean. </description>

    <title>CESM2 SMOOTH experiments</title>
    <description>The Arctic is undergoing a pronounced and rapid transformation in response to changing greenhouse gasses, including reduction in sea ice extent and thickness. There are also projected increases in near-surface Arctic winds. This study addresses how the winds trends may be driven by changing surface roughness and/or stability in different Arctic regions. These data are from five experiments using CESM2 with an artificially decreased sea ice roughness to match that of the open ocean. The data included include only select variables from the atmospheric and sea ice model components. These variables are included because they were used for figures and analysis in the associated manuscript: DuVivier, A.K. et al.

    <title>AEW hindcast using the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere (MPAS-A) version 7.1</title>
    <description>The dataset includes post-processed model outputs from global simulations using the MPAS-A version 7.1. The model was initialized using both ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) and NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) on September 8, 2006 and integrated for 5 days and 6 hours to hindcast the evolution and tropical cyclogenesis of the African easterly wave that became Hurricane Helene in 2006. The dataset can be used to study this specific AEW case and other easterly waves and tropical systems that were active during this time (e.g., Pacific easterly waves active during the same time) as the model was run globally. Although the model produces 15km horizontal grid outputs, the post-processed outputs available here were interpolated to a 0.25 degree by 0.25 degree latitude-by-longitude grid and 27 isobaric levels (in the vertical).

    <title>MPAS-A Aquaplanet Simulations with Different Sea-Surface Temperatures</title>
    <description>Many uncertainties exist regarding potential changes of tropical weather systems due to our evolving climate. This is in part due to existing climate model deficiencies and due to our limited understanding of tropical convection. To alleviate those limitations, this dataset contains post-processed output from aquaplanet experiments using different sea-surface temperatures (SST). The aquaplanet framework is an idealized representation of Earth, enabling fundamental studies on oceanic weather systems and its interactions with the mean climate. Three experiments are included, all of which use the Model for Prediction Across Scales-Atmosphere version 8.0 with 3-km cell spacing between 10S-30N and 15 km cell spacing elsewhere. The experiments are named CTL, minus4K, and plus4K. CTL uses a meridional SST profile mimicking present boreal summer conditions, whereas minus4K and plus4K use meridional profiles mimicking a cooler (CTL - 4K) and warmer (CTL + 4K) climate, respectively. The model output was conservatively interpolated to latitude-longitude grids using the Climate Data Operator software. This dataset contains 6-hourly interpolated output for six months in each experiment. </description>

    <title>GPEP CONUS 0.02 degree multi-decadal ensemble daily precipitation and temperature dataset</title>
    <description> Precipitation and temperature datasets are essential for diverse applications, yet existing high-resolution products often lack robust uncertainty quantification and transparent, reproducible station processing. This dataset resource contains a daily multi-decadal 0.02 ensemble of gridded surface precipitation and temperature for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). It currently spans 1950-2023 (74 years) and includes 10 ensemble members and statistics based on a larger 30-member ensemble.  Links to software to generate additional ensemble members are provided in the documentation. The dataset was created using a framework combining meteorological station record reconstruction and spatial probabilistic estimation. The resulting serially-complete station record archive merges high-density observing networks (GHCN-D and MADIS) using a comprehensive set of gap-filling and reconstruction techniques -- quantile mapping, interpolation, machine learning, and multi-source merging -- yielding 25,887 precipitation and 20,998 temperature stations. Gridded Ensemble fields for daily precipitation total, mean temperature (Tmean), and daily temperature range (Trange) are generated using a probabilistic geospatial estimation approach that characterizes spatial variable uncertainty via cross-validation. This open-access ensemble -- together with its station archive and gridded deterministic and probabilistic components -- provides a critical resource for high-resolution hydrologic and climate research across CONUS. </description>

    <title>Atlanta Metro Heat Exposure</title>
    <description>Increasing extreme heat weather is likely to raise the risk of acute kidney injury, which is characterized by a precipitous decline in kidney function. Kidney diseases in heat exposure have been investigated using ambient temperature data collected from individual monitoring stations or spatially gridded atmospheric reanalysis products. These datasets, however, are insufficient for studying heat exposure studies in urban areas because they do not accurately capture the effects of variations in land surface, particularly the 'urban heat island', which temperatures are significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas and can amplify extreme heat events in cities and disproportionately affect public health. Here, we first develop a 1 km^2 resolution of meteorology dataset for 2010-2023 using a fully coupled atmosphere-land-urban modeling system, WRF-urban, over the Atlanta metropolitan area with comprehensive maps of urban types from the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme. We then applied a multivariate bias correction technique to the WRF-urban temperature and moisture variables. WRF-urban is able to reproduce the extreme high and low temperatures near the surface in urban areas by utilizing the LCZ maps that classify different urban types. Furthermore, temperature bias is effectively mitigated while temperature-moisture covariance is preserved by employing the bias correction technique. We also compute many common heat exposure indices such as the heat index, HUMIDEX, globe temperature, normal effective temperature, apparent temperature, wet bulb globe temperature, Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), and wet bulb temperature. The dataset will be useful to quantify relationships between short-term heat exposure and hospitalizations, or other health outcomes, as well as to offer inputs for quantitative risk assessment and economic evaluation of heat-health implications that can improve case management decisions.</description>

    <description>The High-resolution Urban Meteorology for Impacts Dataset, HUMID, will be useful for studies examining spatial variability of near surface meteorology and the impacts of urban heat islands across many disciplines including epidemiology, ecology, and climatology. We have explicitly included representation of spatial meteorological variability over urban areas in the contiguous United States (CONUS) as compared to other observation-only gridded meteorology products by employing the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS), which accounts for the fine-scale impacts of spatiotemporally varying land surfaces on weather. Further, we include in situ meteorological observations such as local mesonets to bias correct the HRLDAS output, creating a model-observation fusion product. The data spans 1 January 1981 to 31 December 2018, covering all of CONUS at 1 km grid spacing. The dataset includes daily maximum, minimum, and mean values for a variety of temperature estimates such as 2 m temperature, skin temperature, urban temperatures, as well as specific humidity and surface energy budget terms.

    <title>Regional Multi-Week Convection-Permitting Simulations using the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS-A) for use in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America Regions</title>
    <description>The dataset includes native-grid model outputs and post-processed outputs from the first-ever multi-week regional convection-permitting MPAS simulation during September 2017, a period when the devastating Hurricane Maria was active. This historic simulation provides a valuable dataset for studying weather and climate across Mesoamerica and the Caribbean using a realistic, storm-resolving model setup. The simulation is the first major outcome of the NSF NCAR Mesoamerica Affinity Group (MAAG) in collaboration with Dr. Kelly Nunez Ocasio at Texas A&amp;amp;M.
MPAS-A version 8.0.1 was used to produce this simulation. The Limited-Area domain extends from 20 degree South to 61 degree North and from 145 degree West to 15 degree West. A variable-resolution mesh with 15 km and 3 km grid spacing was used, where the 3 km refinement region is elliptically shaped and centered at 20 degree North and 80 degree West. The refined region covers Central America and the Caribbean, while the 15 km portion of the domain extends well into South and North America. The combination of a Limited-Area domain and variable-resolution mesh was chosen to be computationally efficient while maintaining sufficient resolution at the domain's boundaries to allow for proper dynamical downscaling of initial and lateral boundary conditions. The model was initialized using ERA5 data to simulate the period during which Hurricane Maria (2017) approached the Caribbean and the eastern U.S.
This dataset can be used to study Hurricane Maria, other hurricanes that were active during this period, and various weather and climate features of the region, such as low-level jets, coastal diurnal cycles, the ITCZ, extreme rainfall, and mesoscale convective systems, among others. While the model produces outputs at 15 km and 3 km horizontal variable resolutions, the post-processed data have been interpolated to a 0.25 degree by 0.25 degree latitude-longitude grid and 27 isobaric levels in the vertical.
The repository also includes namelist files for running the model, a README file, and a PDF describing the variables in each file type.</description>

    <title>Whole Atmosphere Climate Change: Dependence on Solar Activity</title>
    <description>The netCDF files are global gridded monthly monthly mean "h0" files output by the NCAR WACCM-X model.  The "SMIN" or "SMAX" in the file name designates perpetual solar minimum or perpetual solar maximum conditions, respectively.  The date string at the end file name designates the year and month, e.g., 1972-01 is January 1972.  The metadata in the individual netCDF files describes the individual parameters and locations.  The spatial resolution is 1.9 x 2.5 degrees latitude/longitude.
Note that these are "free-running" climate simulations, and so are not representative of atmospheric weather on any particular date.  Rather, the nominal date of the simulation indicates that the lower boundary conditions of CO2, CH4, CFC, sea-surface temperatures, etc., for that date, were employed.  Similarly, constant "solar minimum" or constant "solar maximum" upper boundary conditions were used for each five-year run, instead of time-varying conditions.

    <title>MESACLIP: Nominal 1-degree CESM (low-resolution) simulations corresponding to high-resolution experiments</title>
    <description>Over the past six years, our research team consisting of scientists at Texas A&amp;amp;M University (TAMU) and the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR) has made major breakthroughs in advancing high-resolution global climate modeling and prediction. We have completed several thousand years of climate simulations at a tropical cyclone (TC) permitting and ocean-eddy-rich resolution (hereafter simply referred to as CESM-HR) as part of our NSF-funded project entitled "Understanding the Role of MESoscale Atmosphere-Ocean Interactions in Seasonal-to-Decadal CLImate Prediction (MESACLIP)". Among others, we completed a 500-year preindustrial control (PI-CTRL) simulation forced by a perpetual climate forcing that corresponds to the year 1850 conditions and a 10-member ensemble of historical and future transient climate simulations.
The CESM-HR configuration is based on an earlier CESM version, CESM1.3, with many additional modifications and improvements. CESM-HR uses a 0.25 degree grid in the atmosphere and land components and a 0.1 degree grid in the ocean and sea-ice components. The primary reason for using an older model version, instead of the latest CESM2, is that CESM2 does not support a high-resolution version per the decision by the CESM Scientific Steering Committee. The component models within CESM1.3 are the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5; Neale et al., 2012), the Parallel Ocean Program version 2 (POP2; Danabasoglu et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010), the Community Ice Code version 4 (CICE4; Hunke &amp;amp; Lipscomb, 2008), and the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4; Lawrence et al., 2011).

Here we release the nominal 1 degree low-resolution (LR) equivalent simulations based on the same CESM1.3 code base and using the same CAM5 Spectral Element (SE) dycore used in CESM-HR to permit an as-clean-as-possible comparison of the respective LR and HR simulations. CESM LR uses a nominal 1 degree grid in all its components.

 Citation: The two papers linked below are the most appropriate references for these simulations. To cite the dataset, use Chang et al. (2025). We ask that you also cite the dataset itself using the reference Castruccio et al. (2024) in any documents or publications using these data. Chang et al. (2020) describes the initial CESM-HR simulations, including the 500-year pre-industrial control simulation and the first 250-year historical and future climate simulation from 1850 to 2100. It also introduces the corresponding CESM LR experiments. We would also appreciate receiving a copy of the relevant publications. This will help us to justify keeping the data freely available online in the future. Thank you!</description>

    <title>Four-kilometer long-term regional hydroclimate reanalysis over the conterminous United States (CONUS)</title>
    <description>CONUS404 is a unique, high-resolution hydro-climate dataset appropriate for forcing hydrological models and conducting meteorological analysis over the conterminous United States.  CONUS404, so named because it covers the CONterminous United States for over 40 years at 4 km resolution, was produced by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations run by NCAR as part of a collaboration with the USGS Water Mission Area.  The CONUS404 includes 42 years of data (water years 1980-2021) and the spatial domain extends beyond the CONUS into Canada and Mexico, thereby capturing transboundary river basins and covering all contributing areas for CONUS surface waters.
    
    The CONUS404 dataset, produced using WRF version 3.9.1.1, is the successor to the CONUS1 dataset in d612000 (Liu, et al. 2017) with improved representation of weather and climate conditions in the central United States due to the addition of a shallow groundwater module and several other improvements in the NOAH Multi-parameterization land surface model.  It also uses a more up-to-date and higher-resolution reanalysis dataset (ERA5) as input and covers a longer period than CONUS1.</description>

    <title>FLIGHT+: The Extended Flight Level Dataset for Tropical Cyclones (Version 1.1)</title>
    <description>The Extended Flight Level Dataset for Tropical Cyclones (FLIGHT+) consists of high resolution aircraft observations from thousands of U.S. Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and NOAA Hurricane Hunter flights. The majority of these flights were tasked for operational reconnaissance missions into tropical cyclones (TCs), however the dataset also includes a significant number of research flights as well. Most flights occurred in TCs in the Atlantic basin, however a number of flights are also included from TCs in the Eastern Pacific, as well as a few TCs in the Central Pacific and Western Pacific basins. The current version of the dataset spans the years 1999-2013. Eventually the dataset may span the entire era of modern aircraft observations, from 1977 up to the present time.   The dataset consists of individual Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) files, one for each TC that was flown. Each file contains all of the relevant flight level data for all the flights for that TC, with data parameters grouped as follows: (1) standardized, earth-relative flight level data and associated navigational information for all of the common flight level data parameters, (2) high resolution positional information for the TC wind centers, obtained from the Willoughby-Rahn center-finding method, (3) earth-relative wind speed and rainfall rate data from the Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) instrument (when available, generally from 2007 onward), (4) metadata from application of an automated algorithm to parse the full flight paths into radial legs (the segments of the flight path that are essentially straight-line paths into or out of the TC center), (5) meteorological flight level and SFMR data parameters for the good radial flight legs in both time and radius coordinates. The dataset also includes a number of summary metadata that characterize various aspects of the radial legs, such as whether the leg was inbound or outbound relative to the TC center, the flight level that the plane flew at during the leg, the peak flight level and SFMR surface wind speeds measured during the radial leg, and the latitude/longitude and corresponding radius from the TC center of each wind maxima.   The wind parameters in the dataset have been carefully quality controlled to minimize file reading errors. Visual checks have been conducted to ensure that the peak values of each flight are reasonable. Additional quality control measures have also been applied to the SFMR data. By making all of these data easily accessible in standardized and structured NetCDF data files, FLIGHT+ offers the research community an enormous trove of research-grade data that should prove valuable for wind risk applications and research studies into the TC life cycle and the challenging problems of rapid intensification and structure change.</description>

    <title>QSCAT-R: The QuikSCAT Tropical Cyclone Radial Structure Dataset</title>
    <description>QSCAT-R contains data for the radial structure of near-surface wind and rain rate for tropical cyclones globally during the period 1999-2009. The dataset is derived from the corresponding two-dimensional data fields originally estimated from QuikSCAT satellite measurements and optimized for analysis of tropical cyclones within the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) QuikSCAT Tropical Cyclone database. QSCAT-R includes radial profiles of total wind speed and its azimuthal and radial components and corresponding estimates of canonical wind radii, as well as radial profiles of a quantity proportional to rain rate and, when available, collocated SSM/I cloud liquid data. Additionally, data coverage necessarily varies in space and time due to the nature of satellite remote sensing, and thus QSCAT-R provides a parametric measure of data asymmetry to help quantify this form of uncertainty. Overall, as a relatively small dataset (~100 MB) written in a user-friendly NetCDF format, QSCAT-R offers the research community a significant new tool for the analysis of the radial structure of tropical cyclones in nature.</description>

    <title>CAMELS: Catchment Attributes for Large-Sample Studies</title>
    <description>This dataset covers the same 671 catchments as the Large-Sample Hydrometeorological Dataset introduced by Newman et al. (2015). For each catchment, we characterized a wide range of attributes that influence catchment behavior and hydrological processes. Datasets characterizing these attributes have been available separately for some time, but comprehensive multivariate catchment scale assessments have so far been difficult, because these datasets typically have different spatial configurations, are stored in different archives, or use different data formats. By creating catchment scale estimates of these attributes, our aim is to simplify the assessment of their interrelationships.
                              
Topographic characteristics (e.g. elevation and slope) were retrieved from Newman et al. (2015). Climatic indices (e.g., aridity and frequency of dry days) and hydrological signatures (e.g., mean annual discharge and baseflow index) were computed using the time series provided by Newman et al. (2015). Soil characteristics (e.g., porosity and soil depth) were characterized using the STATSGO data set and the Pelletier et al. (2016) data set. Vegetation characteristics (e.g. the leaf area index and the rooting depth) were inferred using MODIS data. Geological characteristics (e.g., geologic class and the subsurface porosity) were computed using the GLiM and GLHYMPS data sets.
                              
An essential feature, that differentiates this data set from similar ones, is that it both provides quantitative estimates of diverse catchment attributes, and involves assessments of the limitations of the data and methods used to compute those attributes (see Addor et al., 2017). The large number of catchments, combined with the diversity of their geophysical characteristics, makes this new data well suited for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology.
                              
The hydrometeorological time series provided by Newman et al. (2015) together with the catchment attributes described here constitute the CAMELS data set: Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies.</description>

    <title>TC-OBS: The Tropical Cyclone Observations-Based Structure Database</title>
    <description>A new historical database of tropical cyclone (TC) parameters has been constructed from satellite and aircraft observations. Called the Tropical Cyclone Observations-Based Structure Database (TC-OBS), this database uses objective state estimation algorithms to refine existing historical estimates of the following key parameters: track, intensity, and size (radial extent of winds of a given threshold). Additionally, TC-OBS provides estimates of the radius of maximum winds (RMW), a quantity that has not previously been included as a "best-tracked" quantity in existing historical databases. TC-OBS also provides time-dependent uncertainty bounds on the estimates of these four main quantities. Compared with existing historical databases such as the Hurricane Database (HURDAT2, also known as the "Best Track Dataset"), TC-OBS provides track, intensity, and radius information at higher spatial and temporal precision. Whereas HURDAT2 rounds track points to the nearest tenth of a degree, intensity to the nearest 5-kt increment, and wind radii to 5-nm or even 10-nm increments, TC-OBS does not round any of its estimates to artificial thresholds. While HURDAT generally provides parameters every six hours, TC-OBS provides estimates of all parameters for each hour as well as any of the off-synoptic time points included in HURDAT2. Like HURDAT2, TC-OBS provides estimates of the 34- , 50-, and 64-kt wind radii (size), but TC-OBS also adds estimates for the radial extent of Category 2, 3, 4, and 5 wind speed thresholds (83-kt, 96-kt, 113-kt, and 135-kt). Whenever data coverages are sufficient, TC-OBS also includes estimates of the azimuthal mean wind speed. Finally, TC-OBS is set up to include alternative metrics beyond the traditional metrics for intensity and size. One such metric is related to the spatial and temporal coherence of the location of wind maxima. The database was originally built for wind risk applications, but a wide range of scientific and commercial uses can be envisioned. 

TC-OBS currently includes data for all TCs that occurred in the North Atlantic basin from 1999 to 2013. Somewhat more than half of all Atlantic TCs were sampled by aircraft frequently enough to provide useful input data for TC-OBS. Additionally, since aircraft reconnaissance generally commences when TCs move west of 55 deg in the basin, TC-OBS does not provide observational refinement for TCs in the eastern half of the basin. For the most part however, there is good aircraft coverage during nearly all periods in which TCs were threatening land, so TC-OBS provides observational refinements for nearly all the impactful landfalls in the basin. The current version of TC-OBS (v0.42) provides observational refinements for 253 of the 416 TCs that occurred during 1999 to 2013.</description>

    <description>This work aims at investigating the numerical properties of the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM) using idealized marine ice sheet set up from the MISMIP3d and MISMIP+ experiments. These experiments have the goal in testing CISM to infer model configuration for real Antarctic simulations. In these experiments we investigate several parameters such as stress balance approximation, basal friction law, grounding line parameterization, basal melt parameterization, and resolution. These simulations combine steady state and transient simulations.</description>

    <description>This dataset is associated with the publication "Physical Processes Driving the Response of the F2-region Ionosphere to the 21 August 2017 Solar Eclipse at Millstone Hill". 

In particular, the NCAR- Community model: high-resolution thermosphere-ionosphere-electrodynamics general circulation model (TIEGCM) has been used to investigate the response of ionospheric F2-region electron density (Ne) at Millstone Hill (42.610N, 71.480W, maximum obscuration: 63%) to the Great American Solar Eclipse on 21 August 2017. Two sets of model runs were done, one with the eclipse and the other without. Model outputs of winds, temperatures and electron densities, as well as diagnostic variables of key chemical and physical processes that determined the ionosphere responses to the eclipse, were analyzed and used in producing a paper: Physical Processes Driving the Response of the F2-region Ionosphere to the 21 August 2017 Solar Eclipse at Millstone Hill.</description>

    <title>Seasonal Variation of Thermospheric Composition Observed by NASA GOLD</title>
    <description>We examine characteristics of the seasonal variation of thermospheric composition using column number density ratio âO/N2 observed by the NASA Global Observations of Limb and Disk (GOLD) mission from low-mid to mid-high latitudes. We found that the âO/N2 seasonal variation is hemispherically asymmetric: in the southern hemisphere, it exhibits the well-known annual and seminal pattern, with highs near the equinoxes, and primary and secondary lows near the solstices. In the northern hemisphere, it is dominated by an annual variation, with a minor semiannual component with the highs shifting towards the wintertime. We also found that the durations of the December and June solstice seasons in terms of thermospheric composition are highly variable with longitude. Our hypothesis is that ion-neutral collisional heating in the equatorial ionization anomaly region and auroral Joule heating play substantial roles in this longitudinal dependency.</description>

    <title>Dataset to reproduce the figures in "Revisiting AMOC Transport Estimates from Observations and Models" in Geophysical Research Letters</title>
    <description>Reference level assumptions used to calculate the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation transports at the RAPID and MOVE observing arrays are revisited in an eddying ocean model. Observational transport calculation methods are complemented by several alternative approaches. At RAPID, the model transports from the observational method and the model truth (based on the actual model velocities) agree well in their mean and variability. There are substantial differences among the transport estimates obtained with various methods at the MOVE site. These differences result from relatively large and time-varying reference velocities at depth in the model, not supporting a level-of-no-motion. The methods that account for these reference velocities properly at MOVE produce transports that are in good agreement with the model truth. In contrast with the observational estimates, the model transport trends at MOVE and RAPID largely agree with each other on pentadal to multi-decadal time scales.

The datasets listed here are output fields from the Meridional ovErTurning ciRculation diagnostIC (METRIC) package which enables consistent calculations of AMOC estimates at the MOVE and RAPID sections from observations and models. The METRIC package is available on GitHub at https://github.com/NCAR/metric.

The dataset contains two distinct data sources: (1) track files, which contain information about TC position, intensity, and size. (2) gridded data files with radius-height composites of the TC dynamic and thermodynamic structure. There is one track file and one gridded data file for each model. The overall dataset is part of the global storm-resolving model intercomparison project "DYAMOND" (Stevens et al. 2019, https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40645-019-0304-z), and has been used in a study that is currently under review.</description>

    <title>Aquaplanet simulations using CAM5.4-MPAS4 with two different deep convection schemes</title>
    <description>This dataset includes model output from aquaplanet simulations using the Communitiy Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 5.4 with the nonhydrostatic Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) version 4 dynamical core. The aquaplanet simulations has been performed with a global quasi-uniform resolution mesh with ~120 km grid spacing and a variable resolution mesh employing a circular refined region with ~30 km grid spacing centering at the equator and ~120 km elsewhere. Specifically, these simulations are produced for evaluating the Grell-Freitas deep convection scheme (GF), which has been implemented in the CAM5.4 recently, for the quasi-uniform resolution and the variable resolution meshes, compared with the Zhang-McFarlane scheme deep convection scheme (ZM) in CAM. The four simulations are run for three years, but the datasets are only for the last 30 months because the first six months are regarded as spinup. The model output was interpolated to a 1-degree by 1-degree latitude-longitude grid. Details of the simulations will be documented in a manuscript submitted to the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES). The dataset will be shared with readers without restrictions by the journal's data policy.</description>

    <title>Exceptional multi-year prediction skill of the Kuroshio Extension in the high-resolution CESM decadal prediction system</title>
    <description>The Kuroshio Extension (KE) has far-reaching influences on climate as well as on local marine ecosystems. Thus, skillful multi-year to decadal prediction of the KE state and understanding sources of skill are valuable. Retrospective forecasts using the high-resolution CESM show exceptional skill in predicting KE variability up to lead year 4, substantially higher than the skill found in a similarly configured low-resolution CESM. The higher skill is attained because the high-resolution system can more realistically simulate the westward Rossby wave propagation of initialized ocean anomalies in the central North Pacific and their expression within the sharp KE front, and does not suffer from spurious variability near Japan present in the low-resolution CESM that interferes with the incoming wave propagation. These results argue for the use of high-resolution models for future studies that aim to predict changes in western boundary current systems and associated biological fields.</description>

    <title>CESM2 Atmospheric CO2 without agricultural management</title>
    <description>This dataset was created to understand the impacts of agriculture on CO2 concentrations. Two 1-degree simulations were branched from the CMIP6 "CESM2-esm-hist" simulation in 1970. The first of these turned off the explicit representation of agriculture so that all crop areas are represented as "generic" C3 crops, where crop phenology is simulated as C3 grasses and do not include irrigation or fertilization (referred to as "generic crop"). The second uses the explicit representation of agriculture but removes industrial N fertilization (referred to as "no fertilization"). To ensure that changes in CO2 fluxes were minimally impacted by model drift, each simulation equilibrated carbon fluxes in 1970 by cycling over a single year of forcing for ten years. The CESM2 simulated these alternative representations of agriculture in a CO2 emissions-forced historical scenario following the "esm-hist" experimental protocol.</description>

    <title>Chemistry contribution to stratospheric ozone depletion after the unprecedented water-rich Hunga Tonga eruption</title>
    <description>This datasets provide basis of our analysis in the paper - Chemistry contribution to stratospheric ozone depletion after the unprecedented water-rich Hunga Tonga eruption. We run two different nudged cases: the volcano case with forcing (SO2 and H2O injection) from the HTHH eruption and the control case with no forcing (no SO2 or H2O injection) from the HTHH eruption. The difference between these two nudged simulations gives information about the chemistry contribution to stratospheric ozone depletion after the HTHH eruption. Only the datasets used in analysis are archived here.

The data archived here is about 28GB in the Netcdf format. It has a horizontal resolution of 0.9Â° latitude Ã 1.25Â° longitude, and 110 vertical levels, with a vertical resolution of ~500m in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.</description>

    <title>Data and Workflows Supporting Ensemble Methods for Parameter Estimation of WRF-Hydro</title>
    <description>The WRF-Hydro hydrological model has been used in many applications in the past with some level of history matching in the majority of these studies. In this study, we use the iterative Ensemble Smoother (iES), a powerful parameter estimation methodology implemented in the open-source PEST++ software. The iES provides an ensemble solution with an uncertainty bound instead of a single best estimate which has been the common approach in the previous WRF-Hydro studies. We discuss the importance of accounting for observation noise which results in a wider spread in the model solution. We investigate the impact of constructing objective functions by differentially weighting the observations to tune the model response toward model outputs appropriate for a specific application. Results confirm the necessity of differentially weighting the observations before calculation of the objective function as the optimization algorithm struggles with calculating parameter updates with uniform weighting. We also show that we achieve better model performance in terms of verification metrics with higher emphasis on the high flow events, when the objective function is tuned toward an application where the extreme events are of importance. We then investigate the impact of estimating more parameters, where we estimate a larger number of snow parameters. Results show a large improvement in the model performance. In summary, our study demonstrates the efficacy of employing iES alongside differential weighting of observations, highlighting its potential to enhance hydrological model parameter estimation.

This release of data and workflows has been prepared in support of the publication âEnsemble Methods for Parameter Estimation of WRF-Hydroâ submitted to the Water Resources Research and is organized as follows. 
* src: The source code used for running the coupled PEST++ and WRFHydro model on NCAR supercomputer Cheyenne and Derecho. 
* Prototype_runs: This folder contains all the input domains used in this study, outputs of the calibration using PEST++ and the notebooks used to analyze the outputs. 

Under the Prototype_runs directory, there are several folders described below. 
* DOMAIN: contains the WRF-Hydro domains for the basins of interest used in the manuscript with the default parameters. The atmospheric forcing for each basin also resides under the domain directory, as well as the streamflow observation (with and without noise). 
* NWM_calibration: FullRouting_best_parameters.csv file contains the results of the NWMv3.0 calibration and the file best_params_09221100.Rdata contains the result of the single gauge 09221100 which was calibrated as part of this study using DDS. 
* Run_data: contains results of calibrating WRF-Hydro using PEST++ for different experiments. 
    ** 1_Single_Model_Run: outputs of running PEST++ with option noptmax=0, which runs a single model simulation for the period of interest. 
    ** 2_MC_Run: outputs of the prior Monte Carlo simulation for each domain, note the gauge 09112200 has three MC runs due to using different parameters per each experiment. 
    ** 3_IES : final outputs of WRF-Hydro calibration using PEST++ (iES optimization algorithm) which is organized based on the order of experiments discussed in the manuscript: 
        *** 1_obs_ensemble_noise  
        *** 2_weighting_observation  
        *** 3_refining_objective_function  
        *** 4_expanding_estimation_parameters
 * Notebooks: contains a sample notebook on how to prepare the differentially weighted observations and performing rejection sampling based on the single model run and the Monte Carlo simulation. It also contains notebooks analyzing the history matching results in preparation of the manuscript. One would be able to replicate the figures used in the paper using these notebooks. Each notebook is focused on verification of an experiment with the order laid out in the manuscript. 
 * Dependencies: contains some dependency libraries for the notebooks. 
 * Scripts: contains a script used in the notebooks. 
 * Outputs: the outputs of running the notebooks will be saved in this directory.</description>

    <title>Single-point CLM simulations with hillslope hydrology at Niwot Ridge, CO</title>
    <description>In this study, we ran ecosystem-scale Community Land Model (CLM) simulations with a novel hillslope hydrology configuration to represent topographically heterogeneous alpine tundra vegetation across a moisture gradient at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, USA. We used local observations to evaluate our simulations and investigated the role of topography and aspect in mediating patterns of snow, productivity, soil moisture and temperature, as well as the potential exposure to climate change across an alpine tundra hillslope. 

This dataset contains output files from single-point CLM simulations with the hillslope hydrology for the manuscript titled 'Topographic Heterogeneity and Aspect Moderate Exposure to Climate Change Across an Alpine Tundra Hillslope'. Local observations from Niwot Ridge, CO were used to force and evaluate these simulations to represent alpine tundra vegetation across a moisture gradient. 

Our control simulations were modified to represent a site at Niwot Ridge referred to as the 'Saddle', with an east and west facing knoll and a lowland area between them. Three columns represent distinct moist, wet, and dry meadow vegetation communities. We used the same model setup to run additional experiments on north- and south-facing slopes. Simulations were run using input data from 2008-2021 (historical) and then extended to year 2100 (future) using an anomaly forcing protocol.</description>

    <title>Contributions of the Liquid and Ice Phases to Global Surface Precipitation: Observations and Global Climate Modeling</title>
    <description>This study is the first to reach a global view of the precipitation process partitioning, using a combination of satellite and global climate modeling data. The pathways investigated are (1) precipitating ice (ice/snow/graupel) that forms above the freezing level and melts to produce rain (S) followed by additional condensation and collection as the melted precipitating ice falls to the surface (R); (2) growth completely through condensation and collection (coalescence), warm rain (W); and (3) precipitating ice (primarily snow) that falls to the surface (SS). To quantify the amounts, data from satellite-based radar measurementsâCloudSat, GPM, and TRMMâare used, as well as climate model simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) and the UK Met Office Unified Model (UM).</description>

    <title>KORUS-AQ posterior anthropogenic emissions</title>
    <description>Top-down emissions of CO from anthropogenic sources resulting from the assimilation of multispectral CO retrieval profiles (V8J) from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT). The assimilation is performed using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) within the global Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry (CAM-Chem) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The initial conditions of CO and some non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), as well as CO emission inventories from anthropogenic and biomass burning sources, are optimized during the analysis step.</description>

    <title>Southern Ocean Air-Sea Carbon Fluxes from Aircraft Observations: Modeling Datasets</title>
    <description>The Southern Ocean plays an important role in determining atmospheric CO2, yet estimates of air-sea CO2 flux for the region diverge widely. We constrain Southern Ocean air-sea CO2 exchange by relating fluxes to horizontal and vertical CO2 gradients in atmospheric transport models and then apply atmospheric observations of these gradients to estimate fluxes. Aircraft-based measurements of the vertical atmospheric CO2 gradient provide robust flux constraints. We find an annual-mean flux of â0.55Â±0.23 Pg C yrâ1 (net uptake) south of 45Â°S during 2009â2018. This is consistent with the mean of atmospheric-inversion estimates and surface-ocean pCO2-based products, but our data indicate stronger annual-mean uptake than suggested by recent interpretations of profiling-float observations.</description>

    <title>A large ensemble of spatially and annually averaged CESM CAM 100-year data</title>
    <description>This repository contains data from an ensemble of 100-year runs on the Cheyenne computer at NCAR. The purpose of this data set is to allow an investigation of how different variables are affected by software and hardware modifications at different time scales. The data was produced by a CESM 1.3 series tag using the CAM5 model version described in Kay et al. (2015). The simulations are CESM startup runs using a present-day F compset (active atmosphere and land, data ocean, and prescribed ice concentration), CAM5 physics at approximately 1 degree latitude/longitude resolution, and the spectral element dynamical core.

The output contains CAM data from 147 simulations each with a 100-year time series (100 time points) of 134 variables.  Of the 147 runs, 139 are control runs that differ only by an order double precision perturbation to the initial temperature, where 114 were from an Intel compilation and 25 from a GNU compilation.  The remaining 8 runs are so-called test runs, each with a single modification (e.g., single parameter, compiler, minor code change) changed relative to the control runs.

The simulations originally output monthly data. The modestly sized dataset released here is a result of annually averaging the monthly files, and then spatially averaging the annual averages over the grid. Each of the 147 NetCDF files corresponding to a single simulation contains the variable names and a matrix of 100 years of annual averages for each variable.</description>

    <title>NCAR-NEON system</title>
    <description>Input data, evaluation data, and results from integrating National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) measurements into single point simulations using the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).

The input data atmosphere data (datm) includes NEON meteorological measurements that provide boundary conditions for CTSM simulations. The evaluation data (eval) includes NEON eddy covariance flux data measured at each tower site, which includes energy, water vapor, and CO2 fluxes that at are time regularized with quality assurance and control flags applied. Finally, CTSM model results (ctsm) include monthly and daily history files of select variables simulated by the model at each NEON site. Additional miscellaneous data products (misc) with site information is also provided.

These v2 data were created because we found errors in the values for latitude and longitude of&amp;nbsp;NEON sites&amp;nbsp;tower sites that were being used in CTSM simulations at the following four site: ONAQ, BLAN, ORNL, UNDE.  These errors were corrected and sites rerun, with corrected data published here.&amp;nbsp;</description>

    <title>Surface seawater concentration of acetone: monthly climatology</title>
    <description>Acetone is one of the most abundant oxygenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere. The oceans impose a strong control on atmospheric acetone, yet the oceanic fluxes of acetone remain poorly constrained. The air-sea exchange of acetone is largely controlled by the surface seawater concentration of acetone. This dataset consists of the surface seawater concentration of acetone, predicted by an observationally trained machine-learning algorithm (random forest). The observationally trained machine-learning algorithm is discussed in Wang et al. (2019). The training dataset includes ship-borne observations from a number of previous studies: Yang et al. (2014a); Yang et al. (2014b); Dixon et al. (2014); Beale et al. (2013); Kameyama et al. (2010); Hudson et al. (2007); Marandino et al. (2005); Marandino et al. (Knorr06). This dataset is in 0.9*1.25 (degree*degree) horizontal resolution (finite volume), and can be used to calculate the bi-directional air-sea exchange of acetone.</description>

    <title>CLM5 Sensitivity Analyses</title>
    <description>These data are the results of sensitivities with the Community Land Model (version 5, CLM5) under conditions of elevated carbon dioxide, nitrogen deposition, and present day transient control conditions. 13 parameters are modified with 5 iterations each, for four different individual flux tower sites.

The CLM5 is the land surface scheme of the CESM2 Earth System model, and these simulations form the basis of a paper currently in press at the Journal of Advances in Modeling the Earth System, which forms part of the CESM2 special issue.

For each site x experiment file, there are monthly CLM history output files for 53 simulations, which are 13 parameters varied across 4 iterations plus the default. The parameter files used can be found in the PFT files. Simulations 1 through 52 access the PFT files in the order 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 31,32,33, 34,... 131, 132, 133, 134. Simulation number 53 accesses the default PFT file (#00).

    <description>This dataset is associated with the publication "SAPS in the 2013 March 17 Storm Event: Initial Results from the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model". In particular, the NCAR Community Model: Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere (CMIT) with Ring Current extension, which is also known as the LFM-TIEGCM-RCM (LTR) model, has been used to investigate the subauroral polarization streams during the 2013 March 17 storm event. The LTR model was driven by realistic solar wind conditions for 2013 March 17. Model outputs of ionospheric electron precipitation energy flux, ion zonal drifts, field-aligned currents, electrostatic potential, conductances, total electron content, as well as diagnostic variables of key features of SAPS were analyzed and used in producing a paper: 'SAPS in the 2013 March 17 Storm Event: Initial Results from the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model'.</description>

Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 19, 209-223, doi:10.5194/hess-19-209-2015, 2015.

We developed basin scale hydrometeorological forcing data for 671 basins in the United States Geological Surveyâs Hydro-Climatic Data Network 2009 (HCDN-2009, Lins 2012) conterminous U.S. basin subset. Retrospective model forcings are derived from Daymet, NLDAS, and Maurer et al. (2002) Daymet and NLDAS forcing data run from 1 Jan 1980 to 31 Dec 2014, and Maurer run from 1 January 1980 to 31 December 2008. Model timeseries output is available for the same time periods as the forcing data. USGS streamflow data are also provided for all basins for all dates available in the 1 Jan to 31 Dec 2014 period. We then implemented the hydrologic model and calibration routine traditionally used by the NWS, the SNOW-17 and Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SAC-SMA) based hydrologic modeling system and the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) optimization approach (Duan et al. 1993).

To retrieve the entire time series dataset, all five *.zip files should be downloaded.  The basin_timeseries_v1p2_metForcing_obsFlow.zip file contains all the basin forcing data for all three meteorology products, observed streamflow, basin metadata, readme files, and basin shapefiles.  The three *_modelOutput_*.zip files contain all the model output for the various forcing datasets denoted in the link names.  Finally, the basin_set_full_res.zip file is a full resolution basin shapefile containing the original basin boundaries from the geospatial fabric.

Note there are two versions of the basin shapefiles included in this dataset.  The shapefile included with the basin forcing data was used to compute the basin forcing data and is a simplified representation of the basin boundaries which will include small holes in the interior of some basins where sub-basin HRU simplifications do not match.  The full resolution shapefile does not have those discontinuities.  The user can best determine which shapefile (or both) is appropriate for their needs.


CATCHMENT ATTRIBUTES

Association paper: Addor, N., Newman, A. J., Mizukami, N. and Clark, M. P.: The CAMELS data set: catchment attributes and meteorology for large-sample studies, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 5293â5313, doi:10.5194/hess-21-5293-2017, 2017.

This dataset covers the same 671 catchments as the Large-Sample Hydrometeorological Dataset introduced by Newman et al. (2015). For each catchment, we characterized a wide range of attributes that influence catchment behavior and hydrological processes. Datasets characterizing these attributes have been available separately for some time, but comprehensive multivariate catchment scale assessments have so far been difficult, because these datasets typically have different spatial configurations, are stored in different archives, or use different data formats. By creating catchment scale estimates of these attributes, our aim is to simplify the assessment of their interrelationships.

Topographic characteristics (e.g. elevation and slope) were retrieved from Newman et al. (2015). Climatic indices (e.g., aridity and frequency of dry days) and hydrological signatures (e.g., mean annual discharge and baseflow index) were computed using the time series provided by Newman et al. (2015). Soil characteristics (e.g., porosity and soil depth) were characterized using the STATSGO dataset and the Pelletier et al. (2016) dataset. Vegetation characteristics (e.g. the leaf area index and the rooting depth) were inferred using MODIS data. Geological characteristics (e.g., geologic class and the subsurface porosity) were computed using the GLiM and GLHYMPS datasets.

An essential feature, that differentiates this dataset from similar ones, is that it both provides quantitative estimates of diverse catchment attributes, and involves assessments of the limitations of the data and methods used to compute those attributes (see Addor et al., 2017). The large number of catchments, combined with the diversity of their geophysical characteristics, makes these data well suited for large-sample studies and comparative hydrology.</description>

    <title>WRF-Solar AOD550 &amp; Clear-Sky Irradiance Forecasts &amp; Verifying Observations over CONUS</title>
    <description>This dataset is fully described in and is a companion of Lee et al. (2022):

Lee, J. A., P. A. JimÃ©nez, J. Dudhia, and Y.-M. Saint-Drenan, 2023: Impacts of the aerosol representation in WRF-Solar clear-sky irradiance forecasts over CONUS. J. Appl. Meteor. Climatol., 62, 227â250, https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-22-0059.1.

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a primary source of solar irradiance forecast error in clear-sky conditions. Improving the accuracy of AOD in NWP models like WRF will thus reduce error in both direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI), which should improve solar power forecast errors, at least in cloud-free conditions. In this study clear-sky GHI and DNI was analyzed from four configurations of the WRF-Solar model with different aerosol representations: 1) The default Tegen climatology; 2) Imposing AOD forecasts from the GEOS-5 model; 3) Imposing AOD forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model; and 4) The Thompson-Eidhammer aerosol-aware water/ice-friendly aerosol climatology. Over eight months of these 15-min output forecasts are compared against high-quality irradiance observations at NOAA SURFRAD and Solar Radiation (SOLRAD) stations located across CONUS. In general, WRF-Solar with GEOS-5 AOD had the lowest errors in clear-sky DNI, while WRF-Solar with CAMS AOD had the highest errors, higher even than the two aerosol climatologies, which is consistent with validation of the four AOD550 datasets against AERONET stations. For clear-sky GHI, the statistics differed little between the four models, as expected due to the lesser sensitivity of GHI to aerosol loading. Hourly-average clear-sky DNI and GHI was also analyzed, and additionally compared with CAMS model output directly. CAMS irradiance performed competitively with the best WRF-Solar configuration (with GEOS-5 AOD). The markedly different performance of CAMS versus WRF-Solar with CAMS AOD indicates that CAMS is apparently less sensitive to AOD550 than WRF-Solar is.

    <title>ECMWF ERA interim derived atmospheric mass, moisture and energy budget products</title>
    <description>As observations and atmospheric reanalyses have improved, the diagnostics that can be computed with confidence also increase. Accordingly, a new formulation of the energetics of the atmosphere is laid out, with a view to advancing diagnostic studies of Earthâs energy budget and flows. It is utilized to produce assessments of the vertically integrated divergences in both the atmosphere and ocean. Careful conservation of mass is required, with special attention given to the hydrological cycle and redistribution of mass associated with precipitation and evaporation, and a new method for ensuring this is developed. It guarantees that the atmospheric divergence is associated with moisture and precipitation, unlike previous methods. A new term, identified as associated with the enthalpy of precipitation, is included in a preliminary way. It is sensitive to the formulation, and the use of temperature in degrees Celsius instead of Kelvin greatly reduces errors and produces the extra term with values up to about 65 W/m2. New results for 2000 to 2017 are presented for the vertical-mean and annual-mean diabatic atmospheric heating, atmospheric moistening, and total atmospheric energy divergence. Results for the atmospheric divergence are combined with top-of-atmosphere radiation observations to deduce total surface energy fluxes. 

These data files are monthly and span from 1979 to 2017, smoothed at T-106 resolution. The data format is NetCDF. A full dataset description is available at https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/31/16/jcli-d-17-0838.1.xml</description>

    <title>Merged Hadley-OI sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration data set</title>
    <description>The merged Hadley-OI sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) data sets were specifically developed as surface forcing data sets for AMIP style uncoupled simulations of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). The Hadley Centre's SST/SIC version 1.1 (HADISST1), which is derived gridded, bias-adjusted in situ observations, were merged with the NOAA-Optimal Interpolation (version 2; OI.v2) analyses. The HADISST1 spanned 1870 onward but the OI.v2, which started in November 1981, better resolved features such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Current which are important components of the climate system. Since the two data sets used different development methods, anomalies from a base period were used to create a more homogeneous record. Also, additional adjustments were made to the SIC data set.</description>

    <title>Weekly Carbon Monoxide Anomalies over Maritime Southeast Asia and Weekly Climate Indices</title>
    <description>This repository contains weekly atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) anomalies over the Maritime Southeast Asia (MSEA) region from 2001 to 2019, as well as weekly climate index data. Total column CO from the MOPITT satellite instrument were converted to column average volume mixing ratios (VMR) and were averaged within the MSEA region on a weekly time scale. A climatological seasonal cycle for the weekly time series was created using all 19 years of MOPITT data and was subtracted from the weekly VMRs to create the anomalies. Five climate indices are also provided on a weekly timescale (Nino3.4, AAO, DMI, TSA, OLR proxy for MJO). For details on the MOPITT CO retrieval parameters and the geometry of the MSEA region, see the provided README file. The geometry of the MSEA region and the spatial range of influence of the five climate indices are also plotted on the provided map. These data are associated with the JGR-Atmos. manuscript "Predicting Fire Season Intensity in Maritime Southeast Asia with Interpretable Models" by Daniels et al., (submitted October 2021).</description>

    <title>CESM/CAM-chem Data for Evaluation of MOZART-TS2</title>
    <description>An updated isoprene and terpene chemical mechanism (MOZART-TS2) for CESM/CAM-chem (Community Earth System Model/Community Atmosphere Model with chemistry) was created and evaluated as explained in the following manuscript: Schwantes et al., Comprehensive isoprene and terpene gas-phase chemistry improves simulated surface ozone in the southeastern U.S., ACP, 2019 (https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2019-902). The hourly instantaneous ozone data for August 2013 for the four different chemical mechanisms (TS1, HL, ISOP, and TS2) and the 10 sensitivity tests performed in this work are included in this dataset. These ozone results will be useful for others to compare CESM/CAM-chem results with other models. Additionally the CESM/CAM-chem SEAC4RS (Studies of Emissions Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys) flight tracks for TS1, HL, ISOP, and TS2 and the nudging tests presented in the supplement are also included. These flight tracks will also be useful to encourage future comparisons of CAM-chem results with other models. Additionally, standard model output for 2013 August monthly average is provided for the TS1 and TS2 chemical mechanisms.

    <description>VAPOR is the Visualization and Analysis Platform for Ocean, Atmosphere, and Solar Researchers. VAPOR provides an interactive 3D visualization environment that can also produce animations and still frame images. VAPOR runs on most UNIX and Windows systems equipped with modern 3D graphics cards.

VAPOR is a product of the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Computational and Information Systems Lab. Support for VAPOR is provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation and by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information

This dataset contains sample files of model outputs from numerical simulations that VAPOR is capable of directly reading. They are not related to each other aside from being sample data for VAPOR.  

To unpack the tar.gz files on Linux/OSX, issue the command `tar -xzvf [myFile].tar.gz` on the file you've downloaded. On Windows, a program like 7-zip can perform that operation. Once unpacked, the files can be directly imported into VAPOR, or converted to VDC. For more information see the "Getting Data Into VAPOR" Related Link below.</description>

    <title>Model and observational data for Morrison et al. (2020) JAMES paper entitled "Confronting the challenge of modeling cloud and precipitation microphysics"</title>
    <description>This dataset was used to generate plots for a paper conditionally accepted in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES), an AGU journal. It comprises four different data sources: WRF simulations, radar observations, an idealized steady-state column model called the Bayesian Observationally-Constrained Statistical Scheme (BOSS), and idealized column rainshaft model using bin microphysics. The WRF simulations consist of output from a set of 11 runs using either bulk or bin microphysics schemes. The version of WRF is V3.9.1. To limit storage requirements, we have only saved a single time-slice of output at hour 6 of the simulations, along with the namelist.input file to generate these runs. The observational data are gridded and rotated composite NEXRAD reflectivity measurements from central Oklahoma. BOSS model output consists of microphysical parameter probability density functions and profiles of (as described in the meta-file for these data). The idealized bin microphysics rainshaft model output consists of profiles of drop mean size, reflectivity factor, precipitation rate, and drop concentration at two different time slices (described in the meta-data file for these data). We are requesting these data be added to the managed NCAR repository so they may be accessible to the community per AGU publication policy and in accordance with a U.S. DOE grant that partially supported this work.</description>

    <title>NCAR/ACOM FTIR Atmospheric Composition Dataset</title>
    <description>The NCAR/ACOM Optical Techniques Project operates three high spectral resolution, solar viewing FTIR instruments at Thule, Greenland (76.5ÂºN, 291.3ÂºE, 225 masl), Boulder Colorado (40.03ÂºN, 254.7ÂºE, 1612 masl) and Mauna Loa Observatory Hawaii (19.5ÂºN, 204.4ÂºE, 3396 masl). These instruments operate within the framework of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition change (NDACC). The raw data are recorded autonomously and downloaded to ACOM servers daily. They are processed at ACOM and produce vertical profiles of several trace atmospheric constituents: O3, HNO3, HCl, HF, CO, N2O, CH4, HCN, C2H6, OCS, H2CO, H2O and ClONO2.  These data constitute a long-term reference dataset for tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry investigations.

The data, along with metadata and full error analysis are saved to GEOMS conforming HDF files. Per our agreement with NDACC and our sponsor NASA, they are uploaded bi-yearly to the NDACC data handling facility (DHF) at www.ndacc.org. For select species, HDF files are uploaded on a near-real-time basis for the CAMS27 project which use the data for realtime air quality forecasting. Once these data are uploaded they are publicly available. The NDACC has implemented Creative Commons licensing designations for data at the DHF. These data maintain a CC0 license.</description>

    <title>Dataset to reproduce the figures and table in "An Outsized Role for the Labrador Sea in the Multidecadal Variability of the Atlantic Overturning Circulation" in Science Advances</title>
    <description>Climate models are essential tools for investigating intrinsic North Atlantic variability related to variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), but recent observations have called into question the fidelity of models that emphasize the importance of Labrador Sea processes. A multi-century pre-industrial climate simulation that resolves ocean mesoscale eddies has a realistic representation of key observed subpolar Atlantic phenomena, including the dominance of density-space overturning in the eastern subpolar gyre, and thus provides uniquely credible context for interpreting short observational records. Despite weak mean surface diapycnal transformation in the Labrador Sea, multidecadal AMOC variability can be traced to anomalous production of dense Labrador Sea Water with local buoyancy forcing in the interior Labrador Sea playing a significant driving role.

The files included here are the post-processed model output fields and associated codes needed to reproduce the figures and table in Yeager et al., 2021, An Outsized Role for the Labrador Sea in the Multidecadal Variability of the Atlantic Overturning Circulation, doi:10.31223/X5ZP68.</description>

    <title>Investigation of metadata standard use by geoscience data repositories</title>
    <description>This dataset supports a paper being written about metadata standard use by geoscience data repositories. The study is being done to better understand which metadata standards and keyword vocabularies are prominent within the geoscience data repository landscape. The findings should be useful for NCAR's evaluation of metadata standards within our own systems, as well as by external data repository staff.

The guiding questions of the study are as follows:
1. What metadata standards are geoscience data repositories using?
2. What keyword / subject term vocabularies are they using?
3. What interoperability challenges are present in the use of metadata and keyword vocabulary standards within the geoscience repository community?</description>

    <title>Single-point CLM simulations at Niwot Ridge, CO with anomaly forcing</title>
    <description>In this study, we ran ecosystem-scale Community Land Model (CLM) simulations using the hillslope hydrology configuration to represent topographically heterogeneous alpine tundra vegetation across a moisture gradient at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, USA. We evaluate our simulations using local site observations and quantify the contributions of plant functional trait uncertainty and scenario uncertainty to carbon cycle outcomes from 2022-2100.

This dataset contains output files from single-point CLM simulations for the manuscript titled 'Plant functional trait uncertainty outweighs climate change uncertainty in tundra ecosystems'. Local observations from Niwot Ridge, CO were used to force and evaluate these simulations to represent alpine tundra vegetation by creating separate plant functional types for moist, wet, and dry meadow communities.

Our control simulations were modified to represent a site at Niwot Ridge referred to as the 'Saddle', with an east and west facing knoll and a lowland area between them. Three columns represent distinct moist, wet, and dry meadow vegetation communities. We then modified sets of parameters (specific leaf area, leaf C:N, and d13C) for each community to represent more resource use acquisitive or conservative growth strategies that could occur with warming temperatures. Transient simulations were run using input data from 2008-2021 (historical) and then extended to year 2100 (future) using an anomaly forcing protocol with SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0. We ran six experiments: two SSP scenarios x three trait experiments (control, resource acquisitive, and resource conservative).</description>

    <title>Data and Code for Yeager et al., 2022: Enhanced Skill and Signal-to-noise in an Eddy-Resolving Decadal Prediction System</title>
    <description>The sensitivity of decadal prediction system performance to model resolution is examined by comparing results from low- and high-resolution (LR and HR) predictions conducted with the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The primary difference between the two systems is the horizontal grid spacing of the ocean and atmosphere models (1Â° for both in LR; 0.1Â° and 0.25Â°, respectively, in HR), permitting a first direct comparison of how skill and signal-to-noise characteristics change when moving to the ocean eddy-resolved modeling regime. HR exhibits significantly increased skill and enhanced signal-to-noise for atmospheric fields compared to LR. This result suggests that mesoscale atmosphere-ocean interaction, which is present in HR but absent in LR, is a key mechanism involved in the transmission of predictable signals from the ocean to the atmosphere. Climate predictions can potentially be improved (and the signal-to-noise paradox alleviated) through explicit representation of ocean eddies and their interactions with the atmosphere.</description>

    <title>Fast 2D-S Data and Imagery</title>
    <description>A 2D-S instrument is a cloud particle probe that contains two orthogonal open path optical array probes, which image cloud particles between about 10 microns - 2 mm in size as they pass through the instrument sample volume.  This imagery is used to calculate the concentration and cross-sectional area size distributions, and to estimate the mass size distribution of the observed cloud particles.  These variables are integrated across the size bins to obtain the total concentration, extinction, and estimated total water content over the observed size range, and is provided at a frequency of 1 Hz.  The particle imagery can be utilized to infer cloud particle phase.  This data does not cover the full size range of cloud particles, and should be analyzed in conjunction with complementary cloud probes, such as the CDP, HVPS, etc.  This dataset contains Fast 2D-S data and imagery collected aboard the NCAR GV during the CGWaveS project.</description>

    <title>Fast 2D-S Data and Imagery</title>
    <description>A 2D-S instrument is a cloud particle probe that contains two orthogonal open path optical array probes, which image cloud particles between about 10 microns - 2 mm in size as they pass through the instrument sample volume.  This imagery is used to calculate the concentration and cross-sectional area size distributions, and to estimate the mass size distribution of the observed cloud particles.  These variables are integrated across the size bins to obtain the total concentration, extinction, and estimated total water content over the observed size range, and is provided at a frequency of 1 Hz.  The particle imagery can be utilized to infer cloud particle phase.  This data does not cover the full size range of cloud particles, and should be analyzed in conjunction with complementary cloud probes, such as the CDP, HVPS, etc.  This dataset contains Fast 2D-S data and imagery collected aboard the NCAR C-130 during the CAESAR project.</description>

    <description>This dataset contains data from the NCAR GPS Advanced Upper-Air Sounding System (GAUS) onboard the Research Vessel Jose Olaya for the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud Atmosphere-Land Study (VOCALS) campaign. The variables pressure, temperature, and relative humidity are calibrated values from measurements made by the radiosonde. The dew point is calculated from the relative humidity and temperature. The geopotential altitude is calculated from the hydrostatic equation using pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. The rate of ascent is calculated from pressure. The radiosonde position (lat, lon, GPSAlt) and winds are measured by use of a GPS receiver in the sonde. NOTE: The VOCALS radiosonde data sets were re-released on June 24, 2009. A correction was made to remove a .4 mb offset incorrectly applied to the pressure data during post-processing.</description>

    <description>This data set provides merged 1-second data products from Mission 1 of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) of the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases Study. Mission 1 took place during January of 2009. These merged data products were derived by combining the NSF/NCAR G-V aircraft state parameters for position, time, temperature, pressure, and wind speed with meteorological, atmospheric chemistry and aerosol measurements made by several teams of investigators. Investigators reported most data at a 1-second interval. The data files are in space delimited format. The NCAR/EOL Research Aviation Facility has recently completed a review and upgrade of its existing algorithms for data processing to incorporate recent improvements that have become available for specific instruments. HIPPO-2 LRT data have been reprocessed and rereleased with these new upgrades. For more info see the Appendix to HIPPO-II Project Manager&amp;#39;s Report: Reprocessing.

    <title>HIPPO MEDUSA Flask Sample Trace Gas And Isotope Data</title>
    <description>This data set provides atmospheric trace gas concentrations of flask samples collected with the Multiple Enclosure Device for Unfractionated Sampling of Air (MEDUSA) on Missions 1 - 5 of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) of the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases Study. The Missions took place from January of 2009 to September 2011. For HIPPO, MEDUSA served as a discretely-sampled comparison for onboard (in-situ) measurements of CO2. MEDUSA flask sample results were joined with selected variables from concurrent Merged 1-second data (cite 1-second). This product accounts for flask fill dynamics by aggregating the 1-second data by weighted averages according to the sample kernel for each flask. Values in this file are identical to those in the discrete file, but are presented here for MEDUSA flasks alone, with additional MEDUSA diagnostic information, and without a correction for the Scripps-NOAA CO2 scale offsets. A supplementary file is provided with this product that summarizes the completeness of the reported data values (MEDUSA_meta_summary.tbl). The completeness entries are the number of non-missing observations for each species in the main data file for each mission and in total. The EOL Version 1.0 data set was created in 2012 and previously served as R. 20121129 by ORNL.</description>

    <title>Canister sampling during OASIS Barrow field intensive Spring 2009</title>
    <description>Several Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) were measured using the whole air gas canisters. One-minute data is reported, although canisters were filled only three times per day, on average. Sample times are reported in Alaska Standard Time (AKST). The measurement sample height for all canisters was at the 18-foot tower location, through the same inlet and silcosteel line as the Trace Organic Gas Analyzer (TOGA) samples for that tower height. Mixing ratios of VOCs in the canisters were determined by later laboratory analysis using Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID). VOC mixing ratios: All mixing ratios are in pptv. Below detection limit -8888 

 Data not available -9999 

 Detection limits are &amp;lt; 25 pptv. 

 PI: Eric Apel, apel@ucar.edu. The data are formatted as an Excel document.</description>

    <title>Humans and Hydrology at High Latitudes: Water Use Information</title>
    <description>This data set contains water use information for Canadian and Alaskan communities as well as general water-use estimates provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the whole of the United States. These data are utilized in the Arctic Rapid Integrated Monitoring System (ArcticRIMS) project to improve the development of the water stress model. This water stress model shows the effects of water resources, humans and climate change in the Arctic. Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on arctic hydrology. However, it is currently unknown which regions of the pan-Arctic are most vulnerable to future changes. In order to begin to address the future change to freshwater availability on a pan-arctic scale, a system of arctic typologies were used to enable the integration of biophysical data with socio-cultural data produced regionally, such as demographics and water values. Those mature data sets were used to study the strategic transformations of the high latitude water cycle. The overall objective of this research is to use a wide array of existing data sets in a synthesis effort to describe the vital role of freshwater in the lives of people in the pan-Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future.</description>

The files contain data for all flights for a variety of measurement subsets and averaging intervals. The types of data collected in the project include 1) high-rate (~ 1 Hz) in situ measurements from many instruments, 2) in situ gas-chromatography (GC) measurements on samples collected over a short (~ 30 sec) period of time but spaced by several minutes from the TOGA instrument, 3) laboratory measurements on whole air samples collected in pressurized metal canisters over short (~ 10-20 sec) periods of time by the AWAS sampler, and 4) laboratory measurements on whole air samples collected in continuously flowing glass flasks with longer (~ 30 sec) volume mixing times by the Medusa sampler. The wide range of representative sample times and the unique nature of each measurement system necessitate several different merged data products.  </description>

    <title>HIPPO-3 Merged 1-second Meteorology, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Aerosol Data [Wofsy, et. al.]</title>
    <description>This data set provides merged 1-second data products from Mission 3 of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) of the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases Study. Mission 3 took place during March and April of 2010. These merged data products were derived by combining the NSF/NCAR G-V aircraft state parameters for position, time, temperature, pressure, and wind speed with meteorological, atmospheric chemistry and aerosol measurements made by several teams of investigators.

    <title>Iquique GAUS Radiosonde Data (EOL Format)</title>
    <description>This dataset contains data from the NCAR GPS Advanced Upper-Air Sounding System (GAUS) station located at Iquique, Chile for the VAMOS Ocean-Cloud Atmosphere-Land Study (VOCALS) campaign. The variables pressure, temperature, and relative humidity are calibrated values from measurements made by the radiosonde. The dew point is calculated from the relative humidity and temperature. The geopotential altitude is calculated from the hydrostatic equation using pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. The rate of ascent is calculated from pressure. The radiosonde position (lat, lon, GPSAlt) and winds are measured by use of a GPS receiver in the sonde. NOTE: The VOCALS radiosonde data sets were re-released on June 24, 2009. A correction was made to remove a .4 mb offset incorrectly applied to the pressure data during post-processing.</description>

    <title>HIAPER Atmospheric Radiation Package (HARP) Spectral Irradiance (SI)</title>
    <description>During PACDEX, the GV collected spectral irradiance measurements in the zenith and nadir directions. This data is stored in IDL SAVE file format, one file per day. To access this data, start idl and use the restore command to ingest the data. Data are available for days there were flights. See the missions page within the PACDEX field catalog for a list of flights made. Please contact Bruce Kindel (kindel@ucar.edu) before using the nadir spectral irradiance data acquired during PACDEX. An aircraft vibration problem related to the mounting of the instrument degraded the stability of the measurements. Some flights are of good quality (i.e. stable to 1-5%) while others are of rather poor quality (30-40% changes). This pertains only to the nadir data. The zenith data was stable to 1-2% over the entire experiment.</description>

    <description>This dataset consists of cloud particle size distributions (PSDs) and mass-size distributions (MSDs) derived from two wing-mounted instruments installed on the NASA DC-8 aircraft: the DMT Precipitation Imaging Probe (PIP), and the SPEC Two-Dimensional Stereo probe (2D-S). The data were collected during the High Ice Water Content (HIWC) field campaign from July 8-30, 2022, based out of Jacksonville, Florida. Research flights were conducted over the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Caribbean Sea, primarily focusing on areas of high ice water content at typical jet aircraft cruise altitudes. Additionally, most flights included a series of low-level flight legs to measure aerosol and microphysical profiles of oceanic towering cumulus clouds. There are additional data files from a flight on September 30, 2022. This was not a HIWC 2022 flight, but was a follow-on to HIWC 2022 using the same aircraft.</description>

    <title>HIPPO NOAA Flask Sample GHG, Halocarbon, and Hydrocarbon Data</title>
    <description>This data set provides a NOAA flask sample oriented data product of meteorological, atmospheric chemistry, and aerosol measurements from all Missions, 1 through 5, of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) study of carbon cycle and greenhouse gases. The Missions took place from January of 2009 to September 2011. This data set provides atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, CO, H2, N2O, halocarbon, hydrocarbon, and sulfur-containing trace gases from flask samples collected with the NOAA/ESRL Programmable Flask Package. Flask samples were analyzed on the NOAA/GMD Measurement of Atmospheric Gases that Influence Climate Change (MAGICC) instrument system and the NOAA/GMD GC/mass spectrometric instrument. Results from 1,374 flask samples are reported. For this data set, the flask sample results were joined with selected variables from concurrent 1-second data. The merging was accomplished by first subsetting and then averaging the 1-second observations corresponding to the fill time range for individual flask samples (e.g., UTSTART_M2 to UTSTOP_M2). This data file is better for instrument comparisons than files constructed by inserting flask values at a single mean fill time observation data file. A supplementary file is provided with this product that summarizes the completeness of the reported data values (PFP_meta_summary.tbl). The completeness entries are the number of non-missing observations for each species in the main data file for each mission and in total. The number of observation given for species observations per mission. The data are provided in one space-delimited format ASCII file.   The EOL Version 1.0 data set was created in 2012 and previously served as R. 20121129 by ORNL.</description>

    <title>HIPPO-2 Merged 1-second Meteorology, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Aerosol Data [Wofsy, et. al.]</title>
    <description>This data set provides merged 1-second data products from Mission 2 of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) of the Carbon Cycle and Greenhouse Gases Study. Mission 2 took place during October, November, and December of 2009. These merged data products were derived by combining the NSF/NCAR G-V aircraft state parameters for position, time, temperature, pressure, and wind speed with meteorological, atmospheric chemistry and aerosol measurements made by several teams of investigators. Investigators reported most data at a 1-second interval. The data files are in space delimited format. The NCAR/EOL Research Aviation Facility has recently completed a review and upgrade of its existing algorithms for data processing to incorporate recent improvements that have become available for specific instruments. HIPPO-2 LRT data have been reprocessed and rereleased with these new upgrades. For more info see the Appendix to HIPPO-II Project Manager&amp;#39;s Report: Reprocessing</description>

    <title>Humans and Hydrology at High Latitudes: Community Information</title>
    <description>This data set contains detailed community information for regions of Canada and Alaska. These data are utilized in the Arctic Rapid Integrated Monitoring System (ArcticRIMS) project to improve the development of the water stress model. This water stress model shows the effects of water resources, humans and climate change in the Arctic. Recent studies suggest that climate change will have a significant impact on Arctic hydrology. However, it is currently unknown which regions of the pan-Arctic are most vulnerable to future changes. In order to begin to address the future change to freshwater availability on a pan-Arctic scale, a system of Arctic typologies were used to enable the integration of biophysical data with socio-cultural data produced regionally, such as demographics and water values. Those mature data sets were used to study the strategic transformations of the high latitude water cycle. The overall objective of this research is to use a wide array of existing data sets in a synthesis effort to describe the vital role of freshwater in the lives of people in the pan-Arctic, how it has changed in the recent past, and how it is likely to change in the future.</description>

These data are from the DMT Precipitation Imaging Probe (PIP), and the SPEC Two-Dimensional Stereo probe (2D-S). Both instruments are two-dimensional optical array probes which record images of particles that travel through their sampling area. The recorded images are then analyzed to produce particle size distributions from 50 microns to 3 centimeters in diameter. The data files consist of data in txt files, and images in png format. The images are contained in tar files by flight.</description>

    <description>This dataset contains the BEACHON-RoMBAS2011 campaign data collected by NSF NCAR Atmospheric Chemistry Observations &amp;amp; Modeling (ACOM) for the Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory (MEFO) between 2008 and 2016.  The complete Manitou data archive contains data in a variety of formats (e.g., ASCII, ICARTT, JPEG) from the following field campaigns: Manitou2008, Manitou2009, Manitou2011, Manitou2014, Manitou2015, Manitou2016, SPIFFY2015, SPIFFY2016, Beachon-SRM (2008), 2010 Beachon ROCS, 2011 Beachon-RoMBAS, and 2015 Rx Burn. No data was collected for the 2016 CSU Cont. project. This dataset contains the data from the BEACHON-RoMBAS2011 campaign. The data are from the Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory (MEFO) that was established in 2008, in an area representative of a middle-elevation (~2000-2500 m ASL). It is a semi-arid, ponderosa pine ecosystem that is common throughout the Rocky Mountain West.  The station location is at 39.1006 degrees North, 105.0942 degrees West and at an elevation of 7700 feet ASL (2347 m). The chemistry tower at MEFO is a walk up type with height of 28m and there were 4 mobile laboratories with 160 Ft2 (14.9m2) space. A variety of data (e.g., meteorological, trace gases, Flux, CIMS) is contained in the Manitou data archive and it varies by year and campaign.  See the dataset readme files for more information on all data collected.  Learn more on the MANITOU project page at eol.ucar.edu/manitou. </description>

    <description>The NCAR Airborne Oxygen Instrument (AO2) was mounted on the NCAR GV during the HIPPO-2 project. The submitted AO2 data are in 1 flat ascii text file per flight. Each file contains running 10-second medians (of the original ~ 2.5-second data) at 1 Hz matching the times in the RAF data files. The files are in NASA Ames 1001 format, with a final comment line of variable names (UT CO2_AO2orig O2_AO2orig APO_AO2orig CO2_AO2 O2_AO2 APO_AO2), spaces separating columns, and 9999.99 for missing data. The reported times correspond to when the air entered the inlet. This instrument measures O2/N2 ratio as well as CO2 concentration.</description>

    <title>Pan-Arctic Land Surface (PALS) model drivers and outputs</title>
    <description>This data set includes forcing data and output fields for multimodel simulations of pan-Arctic hydrology. All models were forced with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 40 Year Re-analysis (ERA-40) data for the period 1979-2002. The forcing fields comprise precipitation, 2-m air temperature, incoming solar and longwave radiation at the surface, 10-m winds and specific humidity at the lowest model level, the latter calculated from dewpoint, temperature and pressure. These are available every 6 h on a grid with an approximate 125 km spacing (the so-called N80 reduced Gaussian grid). Precipitation and radiation fluxes are provided as 6-h accumulations from 6-hr forecasts. Temperature, 10-m winds, pressure and dewpoint represent instantaneous values at the 6-h analysis time. The ERA-40 data on the N-80 grid were interpolated to the 100 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth grid (EASE grid) array.</description>

    <title>Mobile Disdrometer Data</title>
    <description>Most of the 2009 deployments took place around midnight UTC and the 2009 data are sorted per event. Because the disdrometer creates a new file at midnight, there are duplicate file names between some 2009 directories. BEWARE: Because there are duplicate file names between 2009 directories, it is important to maintain the original 2009 directory structure.This dataset contains Mobile Disdrometer Data collected during the VORTEX2 project between 15 May 2009 and 11 June 2009 and between 6 May 2010 and 13 June 2010. The 2009 data are in a single tar file which maintains the original directory structure. Each directory for the 2009 data has disdrometer data from disdrometer 1 (YYYYMMDD_PA01.txt) and disdrometer 2 (YYYYMMDD_PA02.txt) as well as surface observations (YYYYMMDD-POD_H.dat and (YYYYMMDD-POD_H.dat). The 2010 data are in individual files in ATM4 format and have mission summaries with maps of deployment locations.

    <title>Thermal IR Data</title>
    <description>This dataset contains data measured with the IR screen setup which is described in the readme file. To facilitate an overview of the captured situations, this dataset contains multiple short videos. The file names correspond to time in local time (Mountain Standard Time). On 2023-01-24 and 2023-02-27, local time is UTC-7h, while LT corresponds to UTC-6h for the measurements in May. Alongside with the videos, the original data is contained in a proprietary format. To open the *.irb-files, the InfraTec IRBIS 3 software is necessary. Furthermore, the file &amp;quot;SOS_IR_times.txt&amp;quot; contains a list of start and end times of all IR screen setup measurement sequences during the project.  The original data is contained in a Proprietary Format which requires InfraTec IRBIS 3 software. The data have been packaged into zip files for ordering. This dataset and the individual day files are very large and only one file at a time can be ordered in an order. </description>

The complete Manitou data archive contains data in a variety of formats (e.g., ASCII, ICARTT, JPEG) from the following field campaigns: Manitou2008, Manitou2009, Manitou2011, Manitou2014, Manitou2015, Manitou2016, SPIFFY2015, SPIFFY2016, Beachon-SRM (2008), 2010 Beachon ROCS, 2011 Beachon-RoMBAS, and 2015 Rx Burn. No data was collected for the 2016 CSU Cont. project. This dataset contains the data from the BEACHON-ROCS2010 campaign. The data are from the Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory (MEFO) that was established in 2008, in an area representative of a middle-elevation (~2000-2500 m ASL). It is a semi-arid, ponderosa pine ecosystem that is common throughout the Rocky Mountain West.  The station location is at 39.1006 degrees North, 105.0942 degrees West and at an elevation of 7700 feet ASL (2347 m). The chemistry tower at MEFO is a walk up type with height of 28m and there were 4 mobile laboratories with 160 Ft2 (14.9m2) space.  A variety of data (e.g., meteorological, trace gases, Flux, CIMS) is contained in the Manitou data archive and it varies by year and campaign.  See the dataset readme files for more information on all data collected.   Learn more on the MANITOU project page at eol.ucar.edu/manitou. </description>

    <title>ORCAS Airborne Oxygen Instrument (AO2)</title>
    <description>The NCAR Airborne Oxygen Instrument (AO2) was mounted onboard the NSF/NCAR GV HIAPER (Gulfstream-V High-performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research) aircraft (Tail Number N677F) during the ORCAS (O2/N2 Ratio and CO2 Airborne Southern Ocean Study) campaign with research flights from Punta Arenas, Chile from 5 January to 29 February 2016. The submitted AO2 data are in 1 flat ascii text file per flight. Each file contains 1 Hz interpolated values (of the original ~ 2.5-second data) matching the times in the RAF data files. The files are in NASA Ames 1001 format, with a final comment line of variable names (UT CO2_AO2orig O2_AO2orig APO_AO2orig CO2_AO2 O2_AO2 APO_AO2), spaces separating columns, and 9999.99 for missing data. The reported times correspond to when the air entered the inlet. This instrument measures O2/N2 ratio as well as CO2 concentration.</description>

    <title>HIPPO Merged 10-Second Meteorology, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Aerosol Data</title>
    <description>This data set provides the merged 10-second data product of meteorological, atmospheric chemistry, and aerosol measurements from all Missions, 1 through 5, of the HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) study of carbon cycle and greenhouse gases. The Missions took place from January of 2009 to September 2011. All of the data are provide in one space-delimited format ASCII file. The 10-second merged data product was derived by combining the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft navigation and atmospheric structure parameters for position, time, temperature, pressure, wind speed, etc., reported at 1-second frequency, with meteorological, atmospheric chemistry and aerosol measurements made by several teams of investigators on a common time and position basis. Investigators reported most continuously measured parameters at a 1-second interval. The 1 second measurements were aggregated with a median filter to 10 seconds. The fast-sample GC and whole air sample measurements reported at the greater than 10 second intervals (15-120 seconds including processing time) were aggregated to the most representative 10 second sample interval. A supplementary file is provided with this product that summarizes the completeness of the reported data values (HIPPO_10s_meta_summary.tbl). The completeness entries are the number of non-missing observations for each species in the main data file for each mission and in total. The data are provided in one space-delimited format ASCII file. Note that EOL Version 1.0 corresponds to R. 20121129 previously served by ORNL.</description>

    <description>Atmospheric River Tracking Method Intercomparison Project (ARTMIP) Tier 1 developer catalogues. Each ARTMIP method/algorithm (named by developer) submits a catalogue comprised of 0's (no AR exists) or 1's (yes AR exists) for each time slice, for each grid point, using MERRA-2 reanalysis data from January 1980 through June 2017. Derived quantities required for algorithms, such as IVT or IWV, were computed by the ARTMIP project so that all methods use the exact same data. Derived variables can be found in individual datasets.

    <description>
The NA-CORDEX dataset contains output from high-resolution regional climate models run over North America using boundary conditions from global simulations in the CMIP5 archive.

The subset of the NA-CORDEX data on AWS (data volume ~15 TB) includes daily data from 1950-2100 for impacts-relevant variables on a 0.25 degree or 0.50 degree
common lat-lon grid. This data is freely available on AWS S3 thanks to the AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program and the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative, which provide free storage and egress.

The data on AWS is stored in Zarr format. This format supports the same data model as netCDF and is well suited to object storage and distributed computing in the cloud using the Pangeo libraries in Python.

An Intake-ESM Catalog listing all available data can be found at:
[https://ncar-na-cordex.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/catalogs/aws-na-cordex.json]

The full dataset (data volume ~35 TB) can be accessed for download or via web services on the NCAR Climate Data Gateway.

                    facilitate a broad variety of research using the NCAR CESM 2.1 (National Center for Atmospheric
                    Research's Community Earth System Model version 2.1), including model evaluation, ensemble
                    hindcasting, data assimilation experiments, and sensitivity studies. They come from an 80 member
                    ensemble reanalysis of the global troposphere and stratosphere using DART and CAM6. The data
                    products represent states of the atmosphere consistent with observations from 2011 through 2019 at 1
                    degree horizontal resolution and weekly frequency. Each ensemble member is an equally likely
                    description of the atmosphere, and is also consistent with dynamics and physics of CAM6. The dataset
                    also contains corresponding land surface values at 6-hourly frequency. This dataset is a
                    reformatting, with no change to numerical values, of data from the "CAM6 Data Assimilation Research

    <title>CESM2 Mechanically Decoupled</title>
    <description>The CESM2 Mechanically Decoupled Model (MDM) is designed to simulate buoyancy coupled climate variability. The MDM consists of the same model components, including the dynamic ocean model POP2, as the CESM2 fully coupled model (FCM), but lacks anomalous wind stress driven ocean dynamics. Ocean variability in the MDM is therefore primarily buoyancy driven. Different from a slab ocean model (SOM) with a time invariant mixed layer depth, the MDM includes a freely evolving seasonally varying mixed layer depth, seasonally varying mean ocean circulation, and time varying buoyancy driven ocean circulation variability like the AMOC. Key sources of ocean damping are present in the MDM, including vertical mixing, entrainment, and advection by the mean ocean circulation, whereas many dynamical sources of ocean variability, as facilitated through anomalous wind stress driven ocean dynamics, are absent. Comparing the SOM and MDM can uncover the collective role of mixed layer depth variability, buoyancy coupled ocean circulation variability, and ocean damping on climate variations, whereas comparing the MDM and FCM can uncover the role of anomalous wind driven ocean dynamics on climate variability. 

The CESM2 MDM is implemented using the CESM2 B1850 configuration (i.e., pre-industrial radiative forcing) with 1 degree horizontal resolution. To mechanically decouple POP2 from the CAM6, the wind stress forcing on the ocean is prescribed as the 6-hourly climatology. The climatology is computed from hourly wind stress CIME output from a 50-yr CESM2 FCM pre-industrial control simulation. The 6-hourly climatology is linearly interpolated to the hourly coupling frequency between CAM6 and POP2. Wind variability still is applied to the bulk formula for turbulent heat fluxes, thus the MDM remains thermodynamically coupled.</description>

    <description>A 10-member ensemble of CESM2 (1 degree spatial resolution) simulations in which time-evolving SST anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific are nudged to observations (NOAA Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature version 5: ERSSTv5) during 1880-2019. In this way, the observed evolution of ENSO is maintained in each simulation (i.e., ENSO is the pacemaker), with the rest of the modelâs coupled climate system free to evolve. Note that only the SST anomalies, not the total SST, are nudged to observations, maintaining the modelâs mean state, including any model biases. In the East Pacific, the nudging is full strength between 15S-15N and from the dateline to the American coast with a 5 degree latitude buffer region to the south and north where the strength of the relaxation is linearly reduced. West of the dateline, the nudging mask takes the form of a wedge shape, tapering off in latitude toward the Maritime continent.

    <title>CESM2 SSP2-4.5 with Modified Biomass Burning Emissions</title>
    <description>This is a 16 member ensemble of simulations with CESM2 under the SSP2-4.5 forcing scenario from 2015 to 2100. These simulations can be compared with the CESM2 Large Ensemble and provide the opportunity to compare and contrast climate change under a lower forcing scenario. One difference from the official CMIP6 SSP2-4.5 forcing is that slightly modified biomass burning emissions are used at the beginning of the simulation. As is discussed in the CESM2 Large Ensemble reference paper (Rodgers et. al. 2021), the second 50 members of the CESM2 Large Ensemble use smoothed biomass burning emissions over the GFED era of the late 20th/early 21st centuries. While the GFED emissions were not prescribed in the SSP scenario, there is a minor effect of the smoothing into the first years of the SSP scenario and these simulations have been branched from historical simulations that used the smoothed biomass burning emissions. As such, this medium ensemble is complementary to the second 50 member of the CESM2 Large Ensemble. More information about these simulations can be found on the CESM CVCWG's CESM2 2-4.5 ensemble website.</description>

    <title>CESM2-CMIP5 Forcing</title>
    <description>The CESM2 with CMIP5 forcing is a set of climate model simulations intended to disentangle the role of forcing versus model structure between CESM2 and CESM1 for pre-industrial, 20th and 21st centuries simulations.

The CESM2 has considerable changes relative to the CESM1 both in the model structure and in the forcing. In order to understand these changes and their impact on climate variability and change, simulations with CESM2 but with a forcing similar to CESM1 were performed.

Data Description:
 
The CESM2-CMIP5 simulations include:
- A 500-year pre-industrial run
- 10 ensembles forced by historical/RCP8.5 datasets

Due to computational constraints, only a single historical ensemble member runs from 1850-1920. The remaining members were branched in 1920 from the first member. 

The forcing in the CESM2-CMIP5 simulations is comparable to forcing used in the CESM1 Large Ensemble Simulations (Kay et al, 2015: https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-13-00255.1)

    <title>CESM2 Single Forcing Large Ensemble Project</title>
    <description>The CESM2 âSingle Forcingâ Large Ensemble Project is a publicly available set of climate model simulations useful for addressing the roles of individual forcings in historical and future climate change. This simulations use the same model and forcings as the CESM2 Large Ensemble Project and, therefore, can be used to parse the relative roles of different forcings in responses found in that ensemble where all forcings are applied together. The ensemble members are initialized from 1850 from the same initial conditions that were used to initialize the "macro" members of the CESM2 Large Ensemble and they extend to 2050, following CMIP6 historical forcings prior to 2015 and SSP3-7.0 forcings, thereafter. Note that the smoothed biomass burning emissions that were used in the second 50 members of the CESM2 large ensemble are used, so these simulations should be compared with the second 50 members of the CESM2 large ensemble. Four primary ensembles are available in which different forcings are time evolving while all other forcings are held fixed at 1850's values i.e, the "only" method is used. Note that this differs from the CESM1 Large Ensemble which used the "all-but-one" method where all forcings were evolving except the one of interest. In the CESM2 ensembles, only the forcing of interest is evolving. Four ensembles are available using the following time-evolving forcings:

GHG = only greenhouse gases evolving (15 members)
AAER = Only anthropogenic aerosols evolving (20 members)
BMB = Only biomass burning aersols evolving (15 members)
EE = everything else evolving i.e., all forcings other than greenhouse gases (15 members)

Note that by "anthropogenic aerosols" here we refer to all industrial, agricultural, domestic and transport related emissions and acknowledge that this does not include any anthropogenic influences on biomass burning, which is instead present in the BMB ensemble. Each forcing that is time evolving in the CESM2 Large Ensemble is time evolving in one of these four sub-ensembles to allow additivity to be tested. As discussed in the release paper cited below, substantial non-linearities are present in the CESM2 Single Forcing Large Ensemble. As part of the investigation into this non-linearity, an additional ensemble was performed which was initialized in 1920 of the CESM2 Large Ensemble members and run with all forcings except anthropogenic aerosols i.e., following the same "all-but-one" approach that was used in CESM1. This demonstrated that there is considerable sensitivity of the anthropogenic aerosol forced response to the method used i.e., "all-but-one" versus "only". We have, therefore, expanded this ensemble to a 10 member ensemble, referred to as xAER, so that any sensitivity of the anthropogenic aerosol influence to the method used can be tested.

xAER = Everything time evolving except anthropogenic aerosols (10 members)</description>

    <title>CESM Large Ensemble Project</title>
    <description>The CESM Large Ensemble Project, led by Dr. Clara Deser and Dr. Jennifer Kay, is a publicly available set of climate model simulations intended for advancing understanding of internal climate variability and climate change. All simulations are performed with the nominal 1-degree latitude/longitude version of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) with CAM5.2 as its atmospheric component. The Large Ensemble Project includes a 40-member ensemble of fully-coupled CESM1 simulations for the period 1920-2100. Each member is subject to the same radiative forcing scenario (historical up to 2005 and RCP8.5 thereafter), but begins from a slightly different initial atmospheric state (created by randomly perturbing temperatures at the level of round-off error). The Large Ensemble Project also includes a set of multi-century control simulations with the atmosphere, slab-ocean, and fully-coupled versions of CESM1 under pre-industrial (1850) radiative forcing conditions (2600 years, 900 years and 1800 years in length, respectively). Details of all model simulations may be found in Kay et al. (2015).</description>

    <title>Neverworld2</title>
    <description>This dataset includes the output from idealized primitive equation MOM6 simulations, and is useful for studying ocean mesoscale turbulence over a hierarchy of grid resolutions (1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 degree). The model has intermediate complexity, incorporating basin-scale geometry with idealized Atlantic and Southern oceans, and with non-uniform ocean depth to allow for mesoscale eddy interactions with topography. The model is perfectly adiabatic and spans the equator, and thus fills a gap between quasi-geostrophic models, which cannot span two hemispheres, and idealized general circulation models, which generally have diabatic processes and buoyancy forcing. The dataset includes a total of 8 experiments because the simulations were run with two different depths over which the wind stress was applied (hmix = 5 and 20 m)

Data Description:

File format: netCDF3

Total volume: 20 TB

Temporal resolution:

Experiments with HMIX=5 m
1/4 degree simulations were run for 32,000 days;
1/8 degree simulations were run for 5000 days;
1/16 degree simulations were run for 5000 days;
1/32 degree simulations were run for 2800 days;

Experiments with HMIX=20 m
1/4 degree simulations were run for 32,000 days;
1/8 degree simulations were run for 6000 days;
1/16 degree simulations were run for 6000 days;
1/32 degree simulations were run for 2900 days;

Each experiments has the following files:

* averages_*.nc (holds 5-day averages); one file per 500 days for the resolutions 1/4, 1/8, 1/16; one file per 100 days for the resolution 1/32;

* snapshots_*.nc (holds snapshots at 5-day frequency); one file per 500 days for the resolutions 1/4, 1/8, 1/16; one file per 100 days for the resolution 1/32;

* longmean_*.nc (holds 100-day averages, but over a longer time period than averages_*.nc and snapshots_*.nc); one file per 2000 days for the resolutions 1/4, 1/8; one file per 1000 days for the resolution 1/16; one file per 200 days for the resolution 1/32;

* static.nc (holds the horizontal grid information);

* ocean_stats.nc (holds time series of domain-integrated metrics computed online, e.g., available potential energy and kinetic energy);

* restart files (so users can pick-up and extend the runs)</description>
